Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought is now firmly
established as the major student textbook series in political theory. It
aims to make available to students all the most important texts in the
history of western political thought, from ancient Greece to the early
twentieth century. All the familiar classic texts will be included, but
the series does at the same time seek to enlarge the conventional canon
by incorporating an extensive range of less well-known works, many
of them never before available in a modern English edition. Wherever
possible, texts are published in complete and unabridged form, and
translations are specially commissioned for the series. Each volume
contains a critical introduction together with chronologies, biographical
sketches, a guide to further reading and any necessary glossaries and
textual apparatus. When completed, the series will aim to offer an out­
line of the entire evolution of western political _thought.

Introduction
The Theory of the Four Movements appeared in the war-torn France
of 180 8.1 By any standards, it was an outlandish, disorganised and
disconcerting mixture of ingredients. A well-observed critique of
marriage, of the iniquities of free competition leading to 'industrial
feudalism', of the tedium of work in civilisation and of the errors
of the French Revolution was set side by side with assertions about
the copulation between planets, oracular pronouncements about the
life-span of the earth, extravagant promises about a new religion
of 'voluptuousness' and a cryptic prospectus of the amorous and
gastronomic delights which would accompany it. No author's name
appeared on the title page and the place of publication, Lyons, was
misleadingly stated to be Leipzig. Finally, whatever the other merits
of the book, the exposition of The. Theory of the Four Movements
itself was bewilderingly brief: barely four pages, much of it in a
footnote, scarcely more than the space-filling digression on the sad
decline of provincial theatre.
Some of these obscurities can be attributed to worries about cen­
sorship during the First Ernpire.2 So can some of the circumlo1

cutions. For instance, the war between France and England was
prudently renamed 'the battle against insular monopoly'. The
author had already discovered that Bonapartist officials were par­
ticularly allergic to military pessimism. But, generally, the bizarre
form of the book faithfully reflected authorial intention. The author,
the enigmatically named 'Mr Charles at Lyons', was in fact the
genuinely obscure Charles Fourier, a small silk broker and commer­
cial traveller around the fairs of Europe. He did not intend the book
to clarify, but to tantalise. His book should provide no more than
'a glimpse' of the truth. It was only to be a prospectus. The theory
itself would be revealed in a six-volume treatise, once supported by
one thousand subscribers.
But when the book was published, ridicule was the only attention
Fourier received. Reviewers did not notice 'the pearl in the mud':3
those intimations of a great scientific discovery discreetly deposited
by Fourier amid the queerly assorted passages which made up the
book. Their attention was riveted by the promise that the Earth
would recover its 'northern crown' and that the sea would taste of
lemonade. The mockery hurt. France was therefore 'punished' by
the author's silence. The first instalment of the promised treatise
did not appear until 1822.4
Despite its weirdness and its inauspicious reception, The Theory
of the Four Movements did represent an important moment in the
history of political and social theory. Not only did it announce the
most extraordinary utopia of the nineteenth century, it was also
perhaps the first to define 'the social problem' as the nineteenth
century came to conceive it. The evils of 'free competition'; the
poverty that accompanied civilisation; the uselessness of the rights
of man without a right to work or the right to a minimum standard
of living; the resort to adultery or prostitution as the product of
women's subordination; the hypocrisy and 'cuckoldry' which belied
civilised marriage; the misery, waste and overproduction which
resulted from the lack of association between capital, labour and

talent; the tedium and monotony of 'civilised' work: these were
issues repeatedly raised in subsequent nineteenth-century dis­
cussions of the 'social question' or 'the social evil'.
Equally novel was Fourier's definition of the 'social'. This was
now a sphere which at once undercut and transcended the tra­
ditional domains of law, morality and politics. Furthermore this
depiction of the 'social problem' went together with the rejection
of all pre-existing moral and political theory and its supposed result,
the French Revolution. Henceforth change was no longer to be
expected from the political and ethical realm, but from 'the indus­
trial and domestic'. Politics itself became no more than a symptom
of the 'declining' phase of an 'incoherent' social order, a pathologi­
cal product of the mistaken premises upon which civilisation was
based. Similarly, the unit of change was no longer the polity, the
social change of the future was to be cosmic.
For these reasons, The Theory of the Four Movements was
acknowledged not simply as a pioneering exploration of the social,
but also as a founding document of socialist thought. In Harmony
which was within reach of humanity, there would be no need for
the conventional sanctions of political and religious authority. Here
then was one primitive source of all those nineteenth and twentieth­
century visions of the 'withering away of the state' taken as a conse­
quence of the solution to the 'social problem'.
Representing Fourier

After 18 30, Fourier became widely known. In the first surveys of
socialist or utopian doctrine, he was depicted as one of the founding
fathers of the socialist school.5 After the split among the Saint­
Simonians, a Fourierist movement was formed . Under its leader,
Victor Considerant, it became one of the foremost socialist group­
ings in the years before 1848.6 By the 1840s, at the height of its

appeal, small Fourierist groupings were to be found across Europe
and North America and attempts to found Fourierist communities 'phalansteries' - ranged from Massachusetts to Romania.7
Fourier also won a prominent place in the Marxian genealogy of
socialism. In Germany in 1845, the young Engels translated
excerpts on trade from The Theory of the Four Movements while
excusing Fourier's 'cosmological fantasies' as the product of 'a bril­
liant world outlook'.8 Marx's assessment in the Communist Manifesto
was more guarded: 'critical-utopian socialism', of which Fourier
together with Owen and Saint-Simon were representative, was
treated as the product of 'the early undeveloped period ... of the
struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie'. It was commended
for its attack on 'every principle of existing society', but faulted for
its failure to understand the active and revolutionary part to be
played by the proletariat in its own emancipation.9 This judgement
was repeated, but in much warmer terms, thirty years later in
Engels' pamphlet, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. So, however
incongruous, Fourier's name was assigned a place of honour on the
Kremlin wall when the Bolsheviks triumphed in Russia in 1917.
There is no doubt about the substantial historical connection
between Fourier and the nineteenth-century socialist movement.
But if Fourier's writings had so strongly helped to shape the sub­
sequent socialist tradition, already by the 18 30s the connection was
becoming obscure. The idea of a science of the 'social' as the dis­
covery which would unleash a global movement towards harmony
remained embedded in the common stock of subsequent socialist
assumptions. But in Fourier's presentation, this idea seemed part
of a scandalous and apparently ridiculous cornucopia of sexual and
cosmological speculation. It became difficult to imagine what, if
anything, had bound together a critique of free competition or of
the tedium of civilised work with the announcement of a new amor­
ous world or a novel version of reincarnation. To later socialists,

Introduction

the details and extravagances of Fourier's system appeared embar­
rassing and inexplicable. They seemed to have little to do with
socialism, as it came to be understood, particularly after 1850.
Hence, the growing difficulty of assimilating Fourier's writings into
a system of thought, of which he was also supposed to be a founding
father.
In the later nineteenth century, it was Engels who hit upon the
simplest formula for domesticating Fourier into an acceptable
socialist history. His picture was that of the satirist, of the remorse­
less critic of 'the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world',
and one whose 'imperturbably serene nature' made him 'assuredly
one of the greatest satirists of all time'. 10 In this account, due
homage could be paid to Fourier's genius, while the contents of his
theory could be safely ignored.
The Fourierist School of the 1830s and 1840s had been faced
with a different problem. Unlike later socialists who could only
acknowledge Fourier at the expense of his theory, Fourier's
immediate disciples regarded him as the founding theorist of social­
ism, the 'Newton of the human soul'; but only at the cost of dis­
carding his satire and, more flagrantly, the whole sexual dimension
of the theory itself. 11 If the Fourier of Engels was the unsurpassed
satirist of bourgeois society, the Fourier of the Fourierists was the
great and solemn humanitarian, the philanthropist who had solved
the problem of human misery, the genial, yet practical social
reformer who had charted the passage to harmony. In the semi­
official biography of Charles Pellarin in 18 39, Fourier was turned
into a saintly figure, a chaste teetotaller with lovable eccentricities,
a lover of flowers and cats.12
In fact, Fourier was neither a humanitarian nor a satirist, nor
even, as the later twentieth century has liked to portray him, the
precursor of surrealist or modernist poetics. If, as Barthes for

instance suggests, Fourier's text can be read as that of a 'logothete',
it is not because his project was Judie or parodic. 13 His solemn claim
upon the world was not that of the writer, of the playful maestro
of the signifier, but of the inventor, the 'Columbus' of the social,
the projector of true cosmic order, determined to ensure his patent.
By taking more seriously Fourier's claim to have made a 'discovery'
and by clearing away, so far as is possible, later assumptions of
meaning superimposed upon Fourier's work, it is possible to ident­
ify more precisely the source of Fourier's critique of 'civilisation'.
Fourier's formation

Charles Fourier was born in Besani;on in 1772. In The Theory of
the Four Movements, Fourier boasted that it had fallen to the lot of
'a near-illiterate' to confound 'all the voluminous writings of the
politicians and the moralists'. This claim was exaggerated. Fourier
was provincial, but came of bourgeois stock. His father, who died
when Fourier was nine, was untutored, but had made a considerable
fortune as a cloth merchant. His mother was pious and narrow­
minded. Fourier was brought up as heir to the business, the only
boy among three sisters. He was educated at the College de Besan­
i;on, where he received a firm if narrow grounding in Latin and
theology and in 1789 was sent to Lyons to become apprenticed as
a merchant.
Three points about Fourier's early upbringing may have been
important in shaping his later views. Firstly, if he were by no means
'a near-illiterate', it is true that his background was narrow-minded
and oppressive. Besani;on was scarcely touched by the Enlighten­
ment; it was a garrison town near the frontier and the seat of an
archbishopric. The Church was the main employer of its population
of 35,000 and the piety of Counter-Reformation catholicism set the
cultural tone of the region.14 There seems little doubt that Fourier's
childhood experience of this religious milieu engendered a profound
hostility towards the Catholic religion. In The Theory of the Four
Movements, Fourier condemned the French Revolution not for its

Introduction
attack on the Church, but for the imaginative poverty of its religious
and philosophical alternatives. Catholicism remained a central target
of Fourier's attack upon civilisation. Not only can his cosmology
be seen as an attempt to invert Catholic doctrine, but many of the
daily practices of Harmony are also best deciphered as systematic
inversions of the liturgy and calendar of the Church . 1 5
Secondly, the mercantile life for which Fourier was trained was
from the beginning fraught with tension and animosity. It is
improbable that the child Fourier swore a 'Hannibalic oath' against
commerce after being punished for refusing to deceive a customer,
as Fourierist legend would have it. But it is known that Fourier
attempted to run away from his merchant apprenticeship in Lyons
in 1789. A more likely origin of Fourier's deep antagonism towards
trade was the real and substantial fraud practised by his uncle in
the management of the paternal estate after the death of Fourier's
father in 1781. By the time Fourier received his portion in 179 3,
only 84,000 of 204,000 livres remained . 1 6
Lastly, and more speculatively, it may be suggested that the early
loss of his father, his uncle's unscrupulous behaviour and an
upbringing in an overwhelmingly female household must have
helped to shape the strongly feminine cast of his utopia. Whether
Fourier can be considered a feminist has been a matter of dispute . 17
What is not disputed is that no theorist before him had conceived
a more resolutely anti-patriarchal vision of social and sexual order.
Fourier went much further than Montesquieu in arguing that the
extension of the privileges of women provided the basis of all social
progress. His was a systematic attempt to breach the law of the
father at every conceivable point. In Harmony, women were
ensured full sexual freedom at the age of eighteen. No longer con­
strained by monogamy, they were free to form simultaneous erotic
or companionate relationships with several men. Women would
control reproduction, just as children would be free to choose

between real and adoptive fathers. The relation between the child
and the mother would no longer be disrupted by the father, nor
would it be inhibited by the legal and religious authority which
protected the father's power. Harmony was built upon the explicit
elimination of such authority. 1 8 Clearly, Fourier's own childhood,
or rather the day-dreams conjured out of it, supplied much of the
raw material from which this non-patriarchal utopia was composed.
But whatever part childhood played in shaping Fourier's vision
of Harmony, there can be no doubt that it was the French Revol­
ution which set Fourier in pursuit of an as yet unknown science of
'social well-being'. Fourier was not a dispassionate witness of the
events of the revolutionary decade, but an involuntary victim. Early
in 1 793, he set himself up as a merchant in Lyons with what
remained of his inheritance, but in July the city was placed under
siege. The goods which Fourier had purchased were requisitioned
without compensation and when the city fell to the Jacobins he was
lucky to escape execution in the ensuing reprisals. He fled to Besan­
�on and after a brief imprisonment and an unlikely spell as a cavalry
officer in the army of the Rhine, he resumed work as a commercial
traveller for his former employer in Lyons. His work took him
mainly to Marseilles, the centre of a region ravaged by poverty,
crime and brigandage . It was there in the late 1 790s, in an economy
afflicted by food shortages and by wartime profiteering, that Fouri­
er's theory of 'free competition' as the 'declining' phase of civilis­
ation took shape. For Fourier, these local calamities were but the
symptoms of a universal condition, a basic disorder of civilisation
with cosmic consequences.
At what stage Fourier came to consider that immediate events
could only be understood in the light of a universal theory is not
known. But the ambition to discover such a theory was already
present in 1 799, when he spent a year in Paris studying natural
sciences at the Bibliotheque Nationale. Here he made his 'Col­
umbus-like' discovery of the universal science of 'passionate attrac­
tion' . By 1 800, however, he had spent what remained of his fortune
and was forced back to work for his old employer. Now he was
indeed 'the lowly shop-sergeant' described in The Theory of the Four
Movements.

Introduction
In 1 803 Fourier attracted attention in the Lyons press with an
enigmatic proclamation of his discovery, together with some out­
rageous samples from his cosmology. In the same year, after receiv­
ing an official reprimand for a pessimistic article on the likely out­
come of the struggle between France and Russia, 1 9 Fourier wrote
a ten-page 'Letter to the High Judge' outlining his 'discovery' and
requesting that it be communicated to the First Consul
(Napoleon). 2 0 This letter, which got no further than the police, is
important because it shows that the essentials of Fourier's theory
were already in place. Thereafter, until his book appeared, his pub­
lications were confined to poems, theatre criticism (some of which
found its way into the book) and a pamphlet attacking Parisian mer­
chants in Lyons. In private, however, between 1 803 and 1 806 Four­
ier laboured on a manuscript, developing his criticism of metaphys­
ics, politics, political economy and moral philosophy. Parts of this
were used in the third 'critical' section of his book. 2 1 The Theory
of the Four Movements itself was put together in the course of I 807.
According to Fourier's later account, it was hurriedly composed
partly to satisfy requests from the 'curious', and partly to escape a
yet stricter censorship law imposed the following year.
The theory of passionate attraction

If Fourier is treated as he treated himself, as an inventor, questions
about his seriousness become easier to answer. The ambition to
tantalise, the mischievous setting of 'the pearl in the mud', formed
part of an armoury of artless devices, designed to protect the dis­
covery itself. Despite later denials, it is clear that Fourier hoped
his book would be taken seriously. An all-too-successful determi­
nation to protect his invention appears to have been the reason why,
alongside claims for his scientific discovery, Fourier had inter­
spersed speculations about Earth's barren efforts to procreate, the

Introduction
future recovery of its six moons, the prospective end of sea monsters
and the future lemonade flavouring of the sea.
Fourier's claim was to have stumbled upon the 'social compass'.
It was with the aid of 'a small calculation about association' that he
was able to uncover the 'analytic and synthetic calculus of passionate
attraction', his 'Columbus-like' discovery of 1799. His claim was
not to have conceived a vision of human community as it might be,
but to have 'discovered' a science of the world as it was. 2 2
The steps towards this discovery were recounted in The Theory
of the Four Movements. What disturbed Fourier about the Revol­
ution and its aftermath was not the disappearance of traditional
authority, but rather the calamitous results of putting into practice
the errors of metaphysics, the moral and political sciences and pol­
itical economy. In the years up to 1793 , France had become 'the
testing ground for philosophical theories': first the hated Jacobin
cult of equality and virtue, which had driven the country back to
barbarism, and subsequently the 'free competition' celebrated by
the 'economists', with its attendant scourges of poverty and
unemployment.
This experience suggested to Fourier 'the absence of some form
of organisation intended by God but unknown to our savants', or
even that 'civilised industry' was 'a calamity invented by God as a
punishment for the human race'. It was a growing certainty about
the systematic falsity of the 'uncertain sciences' that prompted
Fourier to adopt the principles of 'absolute doubt' and 'absolute
separation' . 'Absolute doubt' led Fourier to question the 'necessity',
'excellence' and 'permanence' of civilisation itself. 'Absolute separ­
ation' led him to seek the source of improvement, not in politics
or religion, but in the sphere of the 'domestic and industrial', which
'would be compatible with all governments' . 2 3
Fourier's researches began with the 'much-despised' problem of
'agricultural association' . How could three hundred families of dif­
fering degrees of wealth be brought together to form a 'NATURAL
or ATTRACTIVE association', 'a society whose members would be
driven to work by competition, self-esteem and other stimuli com­
patible with self-interest'? Fourier's disarmingly simple answer was:

'by the lure of wealth and pleasures . . . passions common to every­
body' and he likened it to the discovery of the compass. 24 The pas­
sions were to provide the lodestar of the new 'social science', just
as the compass guided the helmsman.
Passionate attraction was the source of movement in Fourier's
theory. It was 'the drive given by nature, prior to reflection and
persistent despite the opposition of reason, duty, prejudice, etc.'. 2 5
It was thus 'incompressible' and equally capable of producing har­
mony or chaos. Harmony depended upon the presence of a mechan­
ism in which the passions could be combined. The 'uncertain sci­
ences' of civilisation vainly attempted to repress the passions. But
only the ineptitude of 'the sophists' could have led to the suppo­
sition 'that God could have created the passions . . . without having
drawn up any plan for their employment' . 2 6 To attempt to repress
the passions was to mistake symptom for cause. 'The sole tendency
of the passions' was towards 'concord', but only insofar as 'they
regularly encounter each other in the progressive Series or series of
groups; outside this mechanism, the passions are no more than
unleashed tigers, unfathomable enigmas' . It was the theory of pro­
gressive series which supplied Fourier's source of order. The pro­
gressive series was 'the passional code regulating our domestic,
industrial and social relations'. 27
According to Fourier, there were twelve 'radical' passions to be
combined and a thirteenth, 'unityism', which in harmony would
comprehend the whole. The first five 'luxurious' passions corre­
sponded to the five senses. These concerned relationships with
things and their gratification depended upon health and material
affluence; in Harmony, each sense would be accorded a guaranteed
'minimum' level of fulfilment. Secondly, there were the four affect­
ive passions - friendship, ambition, love and paternity or 'farnilism'.
These passions concerned relationships with other persons and
formed the basis of the four possible types of group, that of friends,
of associates, of lovers and of familial relationships. Finally, there
were the three 'distributive or mechanising' passions, the 'cabalist',
the 'butterfly' and the 'composite' . Their function was to ensure

Introduction
co-ordination between the sensual and affective passions. The
'cabalist' was associated with the formation of combinations, with
intrigue and calculation; it was the favourite passion of women,
courtiers and politicians . The 'butterfly' referred to 'the need of
periodic variety'. This passion was particularly important because
it linked variety to 'rapidity of movement'; it was 'the universal
agent of transition' . According to Fourier, the need for change was
felt moderately every hour and 'acutely' every two hours. Hence
the two-hourly change of activity in the phalanstery. The ennui of
existing society was largely the result of the systematic denial of
this passion embodied in the two main foundations of civilisation:
marriage and work. Finally there was the 'composite'. This passion
encompassed 'blind', uncalculating, rapturous enthusiasm and
engaged both the senses and the soul. The 'composite' was particu­
larly associated with love and was the passion nearest to God.
Out of these twelve passions and the different proportions in
which they might coexist within each individual, Fourier devised
his classification of Srn personality types. Allowing for the represen­
tation of the complete spectrum of personality types in each sex,
the ideal size of the phalanstery was therefore set at I, 620. 2 8
Passionate attraction was not conceived as a psychological theory,
but as the prime component of a theory of 'universal unity' . It was a
primordial force, comparable to electricity in its ubiquity. Newton's
theory of gravity formed but a part of it, for it determined the
movement of all entities both large and small: 'We see that God
confines himself to the sole lever of attraction in directing the
planets and suns, creatures immensely greater than us, and the
insects, which are far smaller than us. Would then man alone be
excluded from the happiness of being guided to social well-being
by attraction? ' 2 9 Fourier's imagery was not romantic. The aim of
science was simply to harness this cosmic source of energy, to bring
mankind within the ordered domain of 'passionate gravitation'

Introduction
according to the theorems of 'passional geometry' .3 0 If human
societies were in disequilibrium, it was because they were wrongly
ordered and thus their movements were 'incoherent' . The multiple
passionate attractions lacked any principle of combination and
therefore blindly opposed each other.
The 'Series', Fourier's ordering principle, was 'a collection of
several associated groups entirely devoted to the different branches
of a single industry or a single passion' . 3 1 Like passionate attraction
itself, serial organisation was cosmic in scope. It did not purport to
prescribe the ideal form of human organisation, but to describe the
principle which governed the natural order. 3 2 Just as the notion of
attraction was borrowed from Newton, so the principle of classifi­
cation into series and groups was derived from the botanical div­
isions of Linnaeus. But classification was only an ordering device.
The enabling mechanisms, ensuring harmony within and between
Series, were provided by the archetypes already found in the uni­
verse: mathematics, music and planetary movement. It was for this
reason that Fourier often referred to the celestial harmonies of
Kepler or to the 'calculus' of the passionate Series;33 or, especially
in later texts, to music. The twelve 'radical passions' corresponded
to the twelve notes in a scale; groups were divided into 'major' or
'minor'; personality types were subdivided into 'solitones' or
'bitones' and could be combined in different keys.34
These founding assumptions had radical implications. The first
was that the passions could only be expressed within a collectivity.
The basic unit in Fourier's theory was not the individual, but the
group, whose minimum number was three. Hence the attack on the
monogamous couple and the 'incoherent' household. 3 5 Similarly,

Introduction
there could be no such thing as individual happiness, worthiness
or responsibility. Harmony was by definition a matter of chords,
not of individual notes. Morality, therefore, based upon notions of
personal merit, was without foundation; it was 'the fifth wheel on
a cart' . 36 According to Fourier, the Christian belief in individual
reward and punishment was a product of the charlatanism of the
priests. God's only law was that of passionate attraction. All the
miseries of the world were solely the result of ignoring this law.
Secondly, the passions were inescapably libidinal in their content.
The tendency of passionate attraction was always towards 'luxury'
or the 'pleasure' of the five senses, towards the formation of groups
and affective ties, and towards 'universal unity'.3 7 Thus, the attempt
by the Fourierist school to confine passionate attraction to a doc­
trine of 'attractive work' was a basic distortion of the argument.
The organisation of work and the organisation of pleasure were
inextricably mixed. The alternative to higher wages - the only
incentive offered by 'civilisation' - was not merely the pallid vision
of 'association' depicted by the Fourierists of the 1 830s. In Fourier's
original picture, the rewards to be enjoyed by the workers were not
only gastronomic or honorific, but also sexual. It was with the aid
of 'the mechanisms of the amorous series' that the combined order
would undertake 'the conquest of the great Sahara desert'. Simi­
larly, the eating of meals would not be confined to the 'simple'
gratification of the sense of taste, but would also involve the 'com­
posed' gratification of all senses. Feasts and the choice of company
would be planned and negotiated nightly at the phalanstery's
replacement for the Bourse and, in the absence of children, might
be complemented by an 'amorous session' .
Thirdly, a s is made clear b y his frequent references t o domestic
service in Harmony, to the different classes of foods and tables, and
to the pleasure of attaining ranks and titles, Fourier's starting point
presupposed a rejection of all notions of equality. Equality was 'a
social poison'. Harmony was only possible if its members were
unequal in fortune, age, ability and temperament. It depended, not
upon sameness, but upon the delights of contrast and rivalry. Econ­
omists had wrongly assumed that poverty could only be eliminated

through the suppression of inequality. Fourier denied this equation.
His solution to the 'social problem' would involve not equalisation
but what he called 'graduated metamorphosis'. 38 Social science was
'the art of raising each class to the condition of the class above it'
and this could be ensured by guaranteeing 'a social minimum' . In
Harmony, both private property and separate classes would con­
tinue to exist, but in a modified form. There would only be three
classes - capital, labour and talent - instead of the sixteen existing
in civilisation. All participation in the work of the phalanstery would
be voluntary and the profits of association would be distributed in
fixed proportions between these three groups. 39
Fourier's theodicy and his critique of civilisation

From this conception of passionate attraction and serial order Four­
ier elaborated two further 'sciences', that of 'the destinies' and that
of 'analogy' . Harmony, for Fourier, was not an ideal towards which
humanity would have to strive, it was a future to which the soul
was already attuned. According to Fourier's most famous saying,
inscribed on his tombstone, 'the passions are proportional to the
destinies' . If the passions produced discord in civilisation, it was
because 'God had to shape our souls for the ages of happiness which
will last seven times longer' .4 ° Fourier shared the ancient and
Renaissance belief in an affinity between natural and divine law,
between the harmony of the passions and the harmony of the
spheres . What was novel was his assumption that the natural order
was still incomplete.
This meant that concord with nature was not a sufficient guide
to the proportionality between the passions and the destinies.
Nature was not adequate, not only because it was unfinished, but
also because it was imperfect and dependent upon human activity
for its perfection. Destiny was to be discovered, therefore, not by
38

39

OC, vol. x1, p . 290.
This distribution of the product was also derived from cosmic principles. Nature
was composed of (I) 'God or Spirit', the active principle and principle of move­
ment; (2) 'matter', the 'passive and moved principle' and (3) 'Justice or Mathemat­
ics', the regulatory principles of movement. Workers, capitalists and innovators
divided the product of association in the proportions 5 :4:3; for the twelve passions
of human nature were composed out of just such proportions. See TTFM, p. 37.

studying nature, but by consulting desire. Indeed, destiny would
have to provide an excess even beyond desire in its current form.4 1
For civilisation, according to Fourier, suffered not from the excess,
but from the poverty of its desires. Its passions had been blocked
and its imagination dulled by generations of priests and philos­
ophers. Thus, nothing was more tedious than the Christian afterlife,
whose only pastime would be the eternal face-to-face contemplation
of the glory of God. In Fourier's alternative scenario, the dead
would be endowed with all the passions of the living and all the
means to gratify them.4 2
That nature was incomplete was demonstrated by Fourier's 'sci­
ence of analogy' . This 'science' rested on two propositions. The
first was that 'there is a unified system of movement for the spiritual
and material world'. Hence, 'the analogy of the four movements,
material, organic, animal and social'. The second was that, of these
four movements, the social was primary. This meant that 'every­
thing, from atoms to stars, is an image of the properties of the
human passions' .
The procedures o f this 'science' o f analogy were, t o say the least,
obscure. But its general purpose was clear enough. It was a new
version of the theodicy. Without analogy, creation would become
arbitrary, universal unity would become impossible, and the critique
of civilisation would lack a systematic basis.4 3 Fourier's theory
depended upon the total purposefulness of creation. This enabled
Fourier to attack both the Christians for their idea of the unknow­
ability of God's purposes, and 'the sophists' (economists) who
doubted the existence of a 'social destiny' . By making creation
incomplete, however, Fourier's theodicy was able to propose a novel
solution to the problem of evil and also allow space for notions of
free will and perfectibility. God had 'left to our industry and our
reason, the honour of intervening concurrently with him' .44 If the
social movement determined the other three movements and if the

Introduction
world was a mirror of the human passions, then evil was a sign of
what remained to be accomplished rather than a necessary imperfec­
tion in the best of all possible worlds.
What, then, was the relationship between this 'calculus of the
Universal Destinies' and the critique of 'civilisation'? In the nine­
teenth century, knowledge of this critique was largely confined to
its economic components. Industry was organised 'around some
reversal of the natural order'. 4 5 Lacking any principle of association,
it needlessly multiplied tasks. Its mode of work was based on
coercion rather than attraction and was therefore scarcely better
than slavery. The disorganisation of industry was associated with
poverty, the main scandal of civilisation. The people lacked the
right to work or any guaranteed 'minimum' and saw 'their wretch­
edness increase in direct proportion to the advance of industry'.4 6
Above all, civilised industry was a system in which the producers
were victims of the depredations of commerce which was 'the con­
stant exercise of lying and trickery' . Furthermore, just as 'extremes
touch' so free competition was turning into its opposite, the rule
of monopolists, 'commercial vassalage' and 'industrial feudalism' . 47
Amidst wars, revolutions and speculation, industry with its mon­
opolies and excesses had become a form of punishment in which
people starved in the midst of plenty: this was Fourier's depiction
of the 'crises plethoriques' or periodic crises of overproduction,
which so impressed Engels.4 8 Under the domination of commerce,
civilisation had 'reached the very bottom of the abyss' . But this
marked the last phase of civilisation. In the coming sixth period of
'guaranteeism' , the commercial body would be subordinated to the
interests of the producers, and the mass would no longer be
impoverished to the advantage of the few.
The nineteenth-century foregrounding of Fourier's attack upon
free competition went together with a muted picture of the cos­
mology and a virtual elimination of the sexual and sensual content
of the theory of passions and destinies. The most traditional and
conventional aspects of Fourier's outlook - his denunciation of

Introduction
hoarding and speculation, his hatred of the Jews, his nationalist
Anglophobia - were accentuated,49 while the strange and uncompro­
mising radicalism of his theodicy was reduced to the dimensions of
a practicable programme of social reform.
Now that Fourier's critique of civilisation is restored to its orig­
inal proportions, it is clear that economic criticism did not play the
exclusive and determining role assigned to it by his later followers.
In The Theory of the Four Movements, the analysis of 'commercial
licence' provided only one of three 'demonstrations' of 'the inad­
equacy of the imprecise sciences' . The other two consisted of an
attack upon the inadequacy of the Revolution's attempt to replace
Christianity and a geopolitical analysis of the English 'insular mon­
opoly' whose function had been to make 'civilised politics ridicu­
lous' . Fourier's main point was to stress that the transition to a new
period would come not through politics, but through changes in
'the domestic and industrial sphere', that is, in sexual relations and
work. In civilisation, both these activities were pursued outside the
framework of the serial code; hence the parallel manifestations of
disorder in each sphere and the difficulty of finding an honest mer­
chant or a faithful spouse.
Women and the poor were the victims of adultery and fraud. But
Fourier neither demonised the oppressors, nor sentimentalised the
oppressed. His followers dramatised the sufferings of these victims
of civilisation in the name of social conscience. But this was a return
to the discredited science of morality. For Fourier himself, self­
interest provided the only spur to action. 5 0 What stood in place of
compassion was the universality of passion. This was what bound
together the cosmology and the critique of civilisation.
The emphasis of the Fourierist school upon changes in industrial
organisation arose largely from its desire to avoid the scandalous
implications of 'the amorous corporation'. But whatever the precise
49 Fourier was himself in part responsible for this change by presenting a shortened

5°

and sanitised version of his theory in 'Le nouveau monde industriel et societaire'
(1829). For Fourier's attitude to the Jews see E. Silberner, 'Charles Fourier on
the Jewish question', Jewish Social Studies, 8 (1 946), pp. 245-66.
Fourier discerned an affinity between his approach and that of Bentham: 'I have
only seen one civilised writer who has got a little way towards the definition of
true happiness; it is Mr Bentham who demands realities and not illusions; all the
others are so far from the goal that they are not worth criticising' ' 'Le nouveau
monde', OC, vol. VI, p. 348.

Introduction
mechanism of transition from civilisation to 'the combined order',
it is clear that in Fourier's picture historical change was propelled
less by changes in the organisation of production than by changes
in the practice of love. Underlying the thirty-two periods of the
Earth's allotted life was a familiar tripartite division drawn from
sacred history. But in place of the Biblical story, Fourier's 'fall'
was defined by the emergence of the 'incoherent household', the
subjection of women and the poverty engendered by 'excessive
procreation' . 5 1
If God had given 'amorous custom so much influence over the
social mechanism', it was because he only recognised a 'freedom
that encompasses both sexes' . Similarly God decreed that after civi­
lisation the succession of periods would be distinguished by 'the
progressive liberation of the weaker sex' . Women were moved by
desire and thus closer to God's design . To judge them by their
present state would be akin to 'judging beavers by the stupefaction
they show in captivity' . It was women who suffered the most in
civilisation, and if they did not take the lead in attacking it, it was
because they were trained in a spirit of servility and numbed by
the dullness of housework. But in the combined order, women
would surpass men, just as children would surpass adults. For the
mechanisms of attraction were 'the opposite in every way of civilised
opinion' . They worked not from strong to weak, but from weak to
strong. 52
Conclusion

Whatever the extravagance and eccentricity of its detail, The Theory
of the Four Movements provides an invaluable insight into the origins
of socialist criticism. Conventional scholarship still tends to attri­
bute the origins of 'socialism' to a heightened concern for equality
arising from the French Revolution and to the economic changes
consequent upon the 'industrial revolution'. In Fourier's case, it is
clear that these were not his preoccupations. Conceived at the end
of the revolutionary decade, this text is most immediately a
reminder that the French Revolution had involved not only the

transformation of the state, but also the attempt to replace the
Church. Fourier's economic criticism, so influential in shaping the
subsequent socialist tradition, began in this context. The Theory of
the Four Movements is a reminder that 'socialism' began as an
attempt to discover a successor, not to capitalism, but to the Chris­
tian Church.

by Anthropos (Paris, 1 966-8). The Oeuvres completes are, in fact,
far from being complete, as Fourier left 98 notebooks and a mass
of manuscript material which was selectively quarried for the 1 84 1
edition. Most o f this material remains unpublished. For a detailed
description of it, see Emile Poulat, Les Cahiers manuscrits de Fourier;
itude historique et inventaire raisonne (Paris, 1 957).
For the edition of 1 84 1 , the editors incorporated a number of
changes and additions taken from Fourier's own annotations to
three copies of the 1 808 edition, all of which they marked by enclos­
ing them within sq uare brackets. I have followed this practice for
substantive changes or corrections, while omitting minor additions,
emendations and stylistic changes. I have also followed the 1 84 1
editors i n replacing the word 'Sect', which Fourier used throughout
the first edition, with the more familar 'Series', and in capitalising
terms such as 'Civilisation' and ' General Destinies' . Tracing Fouri­
er's citations from other writers has not been straightforward. It is
not always clear how far he read these texts in their original forms,
and how far in anthologies or other edited collections; furthermore,
his quotations are not always accurate, nor correctly attributed
(where they are attributed at all). Wherever possible, I have pro­
vided references for them in the footnotes: some, however, remain

unidentified . Fourier's own footnotes, or those of the 1 84 1 editors
incorporating his emendations, are lettered; my editorial footnotes
are numbered. I have also modernised geographical names in almost
all cases, using the forms currently given in the Times Atlas of the
World, seventh edition (thus, for example, Fourier's 'Zuruchai'tu' is
rendered as 'Starotsurukhaytuy'). In two or three cases I have been
unable to identify the place he intended, and have left those names
in the form Fourier used.
In basing the translation on the first edition I have used the 1 967
edition edited by Simone Debout (Paris, Jean-Jacques Pauvert,
1 967), silently correcting a few mistranscriptions, and I would like
to record my acknowledgement to that edition. I have also consulted
earlier translations of some excerpts which appeared in Selections
from the Works of Fourier, translated by Julia Franklin (Swan
Sonneschein and Co. , 1 90 1 ), and in The Utopian Vision of Charles
Fourier. Selected Texts on Work, Love and Passionate Attraction,
translated, edited and with an introduction by Jonathan Beecher
and Richard Bienvenu (London, Jonathan Cape, 1 972).
It was not until some time after the translation had been com­
pleted that I discovered, in the library of the Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Centre at the University of Texas at Austin,
a copy of a nineteenth-century translation by Henry Clapp, Jr.,
which has been almost entirely neglected and forgotten: ' The Social
Destiny ofMan or Theory of the Four Movements by Charles Fourier,
translated by Henry Clapp, Jr. , with a treatise on the function of
the human passions, and an outline of Fourier's system of social
science by Albert Brisbane' (New York, Robert M. Dewitt and
Calvin Blanchard, 1 8 57). Albert Brisbane's introduction to
Fourier's system runs to 1 99 pages.

Introduction

At the outset of this work, as well as at its conclusion, I want to
call attention to a truth quite new to civilised man: namely that the
Theory of the Four Movements social, animal, organic and mater­
ial is the only subject of study that reason should sanction. It is
the study of the General System of Nature, a problem God gives
all Globes to resolve; and their inhabitants can only achieve happi­
ness after they have resolved it.
Hitherto you have neither solved this problem nor even studied
it ; you have reached no further than the fourth, and lowest, branch
of the theory, the one that deals with material movement, whose laws
have been unveiled by Newton and Leibniz. I shall have occasion
more than once to criticise th;is slow development of human
intelligence.
In advance of the publication of my theory (as advertised)1 the
present volume provides a slight glimpse of it, to which I have
added some extended remarks on the political ignorance of Civilised
Man, the two main examples of this ignorance being drawn:
-

-

In the 2nd part, from the vices of the conjugal system;
In the 3rd part, from the vices of the commercial system;
and from the stupidity of the philosophers, who have done nothing
to seek any better arrangement for the union of the sexes and the
exchange of industrial products.
These are, admittedly, somewhat minor arguments to adduce in
support of an announcement as important as the discovery of the

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
Laws of Movement; but it was necessary for me to expatiate on
some of the absurdities of Civilised Politics in order to make my
readers aware of the existence of a more exact Science which would
refute the philosophic Sciences.
In the course of reading, it should be borne in mind that because
the discovery it announces is more important on its own than all
the scientific work done since the human race began, civilised
people should henceforth concern themselves with one debate only:
whether or not I have really discovered the Theory of the Four
Movements; for if the answer is affirmative, all economic, moral
and political theories will need to be thrown away, and preparations
made for the most astounding, and happiest, event possible on this
or any other globe, the transition from social chaos to universal
harmony.

Preliminary discourse
On the stupidity of the civilised nations which have forgotten or scorned
the two branches of research which lead to the theory of destinies: the
study ofAgricultural Association and the study ofPassionate Attraction.
And on the dire results of this stupidity which, for 2,300 years, has
needlessly prolonged the period of social chaos, i. e. savage, barbaric and
civilised societies, which are far from being the destiny of the human
race.
If we consider the wealth of great minds Civilisation has pro­
duced, especially during the eighteenth century, it is easy to imagine
that they have exhausted all areas of investigation, and that, far
from hoping for great discoveries, we cannot expect even insignifi­
cant ones.
This prejudice will be overcome: men will learn that the enlight­
enment that has been gained so far amounts to scarcely a quarter
of that which remains still to be acquired, and which will be
acquired in toto by means of the Theory of the Four Movements. 1
It is the key to all the discoveries of which the human mind is
capable; it will rapidly initiate us into knowledge which, at the slow
rate of current methods, could take another ten thousand years of
study to attain.
The announcement of this theory is bound to arouse mistrust in
the first instance, simply because it promises to raise men to an
1

In the second edition this phrase is replaced by 'the theory of the "General
Destinies" '.
5

The Theory of the Four Movements
understanding of the destinies. I therefore intend to begin by
describing the pointers which set me on the right track; this expla­
nation will demonstrate that the discovery required no scientific
effort, and that the meanest thinker ought to have been able to get
there before I did, if only they had had the one quality necessary
for this study, the absence of prejudices. It is on this point that,
for the calculus of the destinies, I had an aptitude lacked by the
Philosophers, who, for all their pretence at combating them, are
actually supporters and propagators of prejudices.
I only include under the name of Philosophers authors in the
speculative or inexact sciences: politicians, moralists, economists
and others whose theories are not compatible with experience and
are regulated only by their authors' fantasies. Remember, then, that
when I use the term the PHILOSOPHERS, I mean those of the inexact
class, and not those who write about the definitive sciences.
Pointers and methods which led to this discovery

I had no idea originally that I would be conducting research into
the destinies. I shared the general opinion that they are impen­
etrable, that any calculations on that subject belong with the visions
of astrologers and magicians, whereas the investigations which led
me to them were just concerned with the industrial and political
problems which I shall now briefly outline.
Since the Philosophers demonstrated their ineptitude in their
attempt to put their ideas into practice in the French Revolution,
everybody has agreed in regarding their science as an aberration of
the human mind, and their floods of political and moral enlighten­
ment as no more than floods of illusion. How else, after all, can we
view the writings of these scholars who, having taken twenty-five
centuries to perfect their theories and having brought together the
whole of ancient and modem wisdom, begin by creating as many
calamities as they promised benefits, and lead civilised society back
towards a state of barbarism?
Such was the effect of those first five years in which France
became a testing-ground for philosophical theories.
After the catastrophe of 1 793, illusions were dispelled and
modern political sciences were irrevocably stigmatised and dis­
credited. People thenceforth were forced to recognise that no good
6

I8o8 Introduction

was to be anticipated from any of the knowledge accumulated thus
far, and that they would have to look to some new science to provide
social well-being, and find new and original paths for political
thought; it was obvious that neither the Philosophers nor their
opponents were able to alleviate the miseries of society, and that
their respective dogmas served only to mask the continuing pres­
ence of its worst scourges, including poverty.
It was pondering this that first led me to suspect the existence
of a social science of which we were still unaware, and stimulated
me to try to discover what it was. I was not at all disturbed by my
lack of knowledge: I thought only of the honour of being the one
to grasp what twenty-five centuries of learning had been unable to
discover.
I was encouraged by numerous indications of irrationality, par­
ticularly by the spectacle of the scourges afflicting social industry,
such as poverty, unemployment, thriving dishonesty, maritime
piracy, commercial monopolies, the abduction of slaves, in fact too
many misfortunes to enumerate, all of which caused me to wonder
whether civilised industry was not a calamity invented by God as
a punishment for the human race.
My next step was to suppose that industry was organised around
some reversal of the natural order, that it operated perhaps in a
way that was contrary to God's designs, and that the persistence
of so many scourges could be attributed to the absence of some
form of organisation intended by God but unknown to our scholars.
Finally I thought that if, as Montesquieu believed, human societies
have fallen victim to 'a wasting disease, an inner vice, a secret,
hidden venom', then the remedy might be found by ignoring the
paths our inexact sciences have taken for so many centuries and
with so little result. I therefore took as the rule governing my re­
searches ABSOLUTE DOUBT AND ABSOLUTE SEPARA TION, processes
which need to be defined, as nobody has ever used them before.
I . Absolute doubt. Descartes had some notion of this but although
he extolled and recommended doubt he made only limited and inap­
propriate use of it. He raised absurd doubts, like doubting his own
existence, and spent his time refining the sophisms of the ancients
instead of seeking truths that were useful.
Descartes' successors made even less use of doubt than he did:
they only applied it to things they did not like, as for instance
7

The Theory of the Four Movements
questioning the necessity of religion because they were antagonistic
to priests. But they were very careful not to question the necessity
of the moral and political sciences which provided their daily bread
and butter, and which are nowadays recognised to be useless under
strong governments, and dangerous under weak ones.
As I had no connection with any scientific school, I decided to
apply doubt to all opinions without exception, even regarding with
suspicion arrangements which had universal agreement; for
although this Civilisation is the idol of all philosophical schools,
and the one they believe to be most nearly perfect, what could be
more imperfect than Civilisation, and all the scourges it brings with
it? What more dubious than its necessity and its future permanence?
Is it not far more likely that it is just one more rung on the ladder
of human progress? Does it follow that because it was preceded by
three other societies, Savagery, Patriarchate and Barbarism, this
fourth must therefore be the last? Might it not give rise to others,
so that we could have a fifth, sixth or seventh social order which
might perhaps be less disastrous than Civilisation, but which are
still unknown to us because nobody has ever tried to find them?
Doubt must therefore be applied to Civilisation: we must doubt its
necessity, its excellence and its permanence. These are problems
which the philosophers do not dare to consider because if they
started being suspicious of Civilisation they would risk invalidating
their theories, which are all linked to Civilisation and which will
all fall with it as soon as a better social order is found to replace it.
The philosophers have therefore restricted themselves to Partial
Doubt because they have books and professional prejudices to
defend, and for fear of compromising either the books or the coterie
they have always equivocated over the important problems. I how­
ever, with no shared viewpoint to uphold, have been able to adopt
absolute doubt and apply it above all to Civilisation and its most
entrenched prejudices.
2. Absolute separation. My assumption was that the surest way of
arriving at useful discoveries was to stand aloof in all ways from
the paths followed by the inexact sciences, none of which has made
any discovery remotely useful to the social body, and which, despite
the immense progress of industry, have not even managed to pre­
vent poverty. My task, as I saw it, was thus to maintain a constant
oppositional stance vis-a-vis that body of knowledge. Looking at the
8

1808 Introduction

huge number of writers involved, I assumed that any subject they
had dealt with must be thoroughly exhausted, and I decided to
tackle only problems which none of them had attempted to
investigate.
As a result I avoided any research which involved the interests
of throne or altar, with both of which the philosophers had been
ceaselessly occupied since their science began, always seeking social
well-being through religious or governmental innovations; my
approach, by contrast, sought good only in functions which had no
connection with priesthood or administration, which would rely
solely on domestic or industrial measures and which would be com­
patible with all governments without requiring their intervention.
By following these two guides, absolute doubt about all prejudices,
and absolute separation from all known theories, I was bound to open
up a new field of thought, if there was such a thing, but I certainly
did not expect to grasp the calculus of the destinies. Far from any
such lofty aims, in fact, I began by thinking about quite ordinary
problems, the most important of which were agricultural association
and the indirect repression of the commercial monopoly of the islanders.
I mention these two because both the problems and their solution
are related . There is no way of indirectly combating the monopoly
of island powers without operating agricultural association and, vice
versa, as soon as some way of creating agricultural association has
been found, it operates easily and inevitably to put an end to island
monopolies, piracy, speculation, bankruptcy and other scourges
which industry is prey to.
I hasten to set down these consequences in order to attract a
degree of interest in the problem of agricultural association, which
seems so unimportant that scholars have never condescended to
consider it.
Let me at this point remind the reader that I have deemed it
necessary to give him some awareness of the calculations which
paved the way for my discovery. Consequently, I shall be
expounding a subject which may appear to have very little to do
with the destinies agricultural association. When I myself began
to speculate about this subject I had no idea that such a modest
calculation might lead to the theory of the destinies; however, since
it has become the key to them, it is essential that I should talk about
them at some length.

The Theory of the Four Movements
Agricultural association

The solution to this much-despised problem led to the solution of
all political problems. Everybody knows that very small instruments
are often enough to carry out the largest tasks; a metal needle, for
example, can control lightning or steer a ship through storms and
darkness; and it is with comparably simple means that we can put
an end to all forms of social disaster. It will thus be of interest to
many, I am sure, to learn that, while Civilisation is bathing in blood
in order to appease mercantile jealousies, an industrial operation is
going to put an end to them for ever, without any combat, and that
maritime might, hitherto so powerful, will sink into absolute obliv­
ion as a result of agricultural association.
This mode of organisation was not practicable in antiquity,
because agricultural workers were slaves; the Greeks and Romans
sold farmworkers like beasts of burden, with the agreement of their
philosophers who never appealed against this odious custom. These
scholars were accustomed to thinking that anything they had not
seen was impossible; they imagined that farmworkers could not be
freed without a complete reversal of the social order, yet they have
successfully attained their liberty, and the social order is merely
better organised. The philosophers still have the same prejudice
towards agricultural association as they once had towards slavery:
because it has never existed, they think it is impossible. Seeing
village families working unsystematically, they think there is no way
of bringing them into closer association; or at least that is what they
pretend to think, because on this point as on all others they have
an interest in claiming as insoluble any problem which they are
unable to solve.
Nonetheless, people have occasionally caught a glimpse of the
incalculable economies and improvements that would result if the
inhabitants of each hamlet could be brought together in industrial
society, if two to three hundred families of unequal wealth could
form an association proportionate to their capital and their industri­
ousness to cultivate a canton.
At first sight the idea seems unwieldy and impractical because of
the obstacle the passions would present to any such gathering, an
obstacle which is all the more daunting as they cannot be overcome
in gradual stages. Bringing twenty, thirty or forty individuals
IO

1808 Introduction
together, or even a hundred, is hardly sufficient to create an agricul­
tural association: at least eight hundred are needed for the formation
of a NA TURAL or A TTRACTIVE association. I mean by these terms a
society whose members would be driven to work by competition,
self-esteem and other stimuli compatible with self-interest; this new
order will fill us with enthusiasm for agricultural work, although at
present it is regarded as suitable only for the lowest, and is only
done out of necessity and the fear of dying of hunger.
I shall not recount in detail the research I had to carry out into
the problem of natural association, as it is such a different system
from the one we are used to that it seems best to reveal it slowly;
a mere description might make it seem ridiculous unless the reader
has been disposed towards it by some glimpse of the enormous
advantages which will result from it.
Agricultural associations, given something like a thousand people,
offer such huge advantages to industry that it is hard to explain
why modern philosophers have shown such a lack of interest in the
subject, especially as there is one class of scientists, namely econom­
ists, whose j ob it is to calculate ways of improving industry. Their
failure to search for a method of association is all the more difficult
to imagine because they themselves have often pointed out the
advantages it would bring. For example, they have acknowledged as anyone else could have done - that three hundred families of
associated villagers need have only one well-ordered granary,
instead of three hundred ill-kept ones; only one wine-vat instead
of three hundred, most of which will be inadequately looked after;
and often, particularly in summer, no more than three or four large
ovens instead of three hundred. Nor is there any need to send more
than one milk-maid to town, with a large barrel of milk in a wagon,
thus saving the hundred half-days lost when a hundred milk-maids
all set off to town, each carrying her own jug of milk. These are
j ust some of the savings perceived by different commentators; and
yet they represent scarcely a twentieth of the benefits which agricul­
tural association would confer.
It was thought to be impossible because nobody knew how to
bring it into being. Was this, though, a reason to conclude that no
way would ever be found and therefore that one should not be
sought? Bearing in mind that it would triple the benefits of general
exploitation, there can be no doubt that God was bound to reveal
I I

The Theory of the Four Movements
the means of establishing it, for his principal concern must be the
organisation of the industrial mechanism which is the pivot of
human societies.
The argumentative will still raise numerous objections: 'How can
you forge one social unit out of families, some of whom may possess
1 00,000 livres and others not a sou? How will you sort out so many
different interests, or reconcile so many contradictory desires? How
will you absorb all these jealousies within a plan which unites every­
one's interests? ' To which I answer: by the lure of wealth and pleas­
ure. The strongest passion of peasants, as of city-dwellers, is a love
of profit. When they see an associative community yielding a profit
(other things being equal) three times as large as that produced by
a community of isolated families, as well as providing all its mem­
bers with the most varied pleasures, they will forget all their rival­
ries and hasten to put association into practice. And no laws or
coercion will be necessary for this to spread to every part of the
world, because people everywhere are motivated by a desire for
wealth and pleasure.
To sum up, then, this theory of agricultural association, which
is going to change the fortunes of the human race, appeals to the
passions common to everybody, and seduces them with the allure­
ments of profit and sensual pleasure; this guarantees its success
among barbarians and savages as well as among civilised people,
since the passions are the same everywhere.
There is no urgency about describing this new order, to which
I shall give the name progressive Series or Series ofgroups, passionate
Series. These terms refer to a collection of several associated groups
entirely devoted to the different branches of a single industry or a
single passion. On this, see Note A, 2 in which I set out a few ideas
about the organisation of progressive Series; these are far from being
complete, but they will prevent false impressions about this mech­
anism from being formed on the basis of the few details I have
made public, which always get distorted in the process of repetition.
The theory of passionate Series or progressive Series is not an arbi­
trary product of imagination. Unlike our social theories, the Series
are in all points regulated like a geometrical Series; they have pre2

See p. 289.

12

1808 Introduction

cisely analogous properties, such as a balance of rivalries between
the extreme and intermediate groups of the Series. This is explained
in greater detail in Note A.
Hitherto, the passions have always been regarded as antipathetic
to concord and have been attacked in thousands of books, which
will now have to be consigned to oblivion, because the truth is that
the sole tendency of the passions is towards concord and the social
unity which we believed was so far removed from them. But they
can only be harmonised insofar as they regularly encounter each
other in the progressive Series or Series ofgroups: outside this mech­
anism, the passions are no more than unleashed tigers, unfathom­
able enigmas. Which is the reason the philosophers have given for
saying they need to be repressed : a doubly absurd opinion since the
passions cannot be repressed and, if they were repressed, Civilis­
ation would go into rapid decline and return to a state of nomadism,
in which the passions would be even more harmful than they are
for us, for I have no more faith in the virtues of shepherds than I
have in those of their apologists.
The ordered society that is going to succeed our civilised incoher­
ence will have no place for moderation or equality or any other
philosophical outlooks: it requires pure, ardent passions. From the
moment the association is formed, the stronger and more numerous
the passions are, the more easily they will harmonise with each
other.
I do not mean that this new order will change the passions in
any way: neither God nor man can do that; yet it is possible to
change their course without altering their nature. For example a
man with no money may hate the idea of marriage, but if he is
offered a wife with an income of 1 00,000 livres as dowry he will
happily consent to a union which the previous day he would have
rejected out of hand. Does this mean his passions have changed?
No, just that his dominant passion, love of wealth, has changed
course and, in pursuit of the same aim, taken a route which he did
not like the day before. His nature is unaltered; only the course it
takes has changed.
Therefore if I suggest that in the societary order people's tastes
and preferences will differ from those they have at present, and
that they will prefer living in the country to living in cities, it must

13

The Theory of the Four Movements
not be taken to mean that by altering their tastes they will also have
changed their passions: they will still be led by their love of wealth
and pleasure.
I emphasise this in order to dispel an absurd objection sometimes
raised by those unintelligent listeners who, when they hear any
mention of the changes in taste and custom that will occur in the
societary order, instantly shout, 'So you want to change the pas­
sions! ' Of course I do not. What I want to do is to open up new
opportunities and give them three or four times the scope to
develop that they have in the incoherent order we live in. For that
reason, we shall see civilised people taking against customs or habits
which at present they enjoy, such as family life. They will realise
that children spend all their time at home crying, breaking things,
quarrelling and refusing to do any work, while as soon as they join
progressive Series or Series of groups they will work all the time,
competing spontaneously among themselves, and eagerly finding
out as much as they can about agriculture, manufacture, science
and the arts, being productive and profitable while they think they
are just enjoying themselves. Once fathers see the new order they
will find their children adorable when they are in Series and detest­
able in incoherent households. And when they see that everybody
in the residence of a Phalanx (that is the name I give to the associ­
ation which cultivates a canton) eats so well that, for a third of the
cost of a meal in a normal household, they enjoy meals three times
as delicate and three times as copious, and are thus able to eat three
times better for a third of the household cost, as well as not having
to procure and prepare the food; and when, finally, they see that
there is never any duplicity among members of the Series, and that
people who were coarse and dishonest in Civilisation become radi­
antly truthful and polite in the Series, they will turn away from the
homes, the cities and the Civilisation which command their affec­
tion at the moment, and come together in association in a phalanx
of Series and live in its building. Will they have changed their
passions, just because they scorn the customs and tastes which they
like today? No, but their passions will have changed course, without
having changed their nature or their ultimate aim. It is important
to realise, therefore, that the order of progressive Series, which will
not be in the least like Civilisation, will not produce the slightest
change in the passions. These always have been, and always will

I8o8 Introduction

be, immutable; and they will create conflict and poverty outside the
progressive Series as well as harmony and wealth within the societ­
ary state which is our destiny. Once established in a single canton
they will be imitated spontaneously in every country, simply by
virtue of the vast profits and numberless pleasures this order will
guarantee all individuals, however rich or poor they may be.
I move on now to a scientific consideration of the results of this
discovery.
On passionate attraction and its relations with
the definitive sciences

Is it as a result of contempt, oversight, or fear of failure that scien-,­
tists have neglected the problem of association? The motive does
not matter; the fact is that they have neglected it: I am the first
and only one to have concerned myself with it. Therefore if the
theory of association, hitherto undiscovered, leads to further dis­
coveries, if it is the key to new sciences, their discovery is due to
me alone, as I am the only one who has sought out and grasped
this theory.
As far as the new sciences are concerned, to which it provides
access, I shall just indicate the two most important; and as these
details will not interest the majority of readers I shall be as brief
as possible.
The first science I discovered was the theory of passionate attrac­
tion. When I realised that the progressive Series would ensure that
everybody's passions were fully developed, irrespective of sex, age
or social class, and that in the new order these increased passions
would bring with them commensurately greater health and strength,
I conjectured that if God had given so much influence to passionate
attraction and so little to its enemy, reason, it must be in order to
lead us to the order of the progressive Series in which all aspects
of attraction would be satisfied. This led me to suppose that attrac­
tion, so scorned by the philosophers, was the correct way to inter­
pret God's views about the social order. Thus I arrived at the ana­
lytic and synthetic calculus of passionate attraction and repulsion, which
in turn leads ineluctably to agricultural association. So if anybody
had attempted an analytic and synthetic study of attraction, they
would have discovered the laws of association without looking for
15

The Theory of the Four Movements
them. But nobody dreamed of doing it, not even in the eighteenth
century when analytical methods were applied to everything, except
attraction.
The theory of passionate attraction and repulsion is constant and
completely consonant with the theorems of geometry. There are
many important ways in which it can be developed, and it might
well provide food for thought for philosophers who, I think, badly
need some illuminating and useful subject on which to exercise their
metaphysics.
To continue with the antecedents and connections of the new
sciences, I soon saw that the laws of passionate attraction agreed in
all respects with the laws of material attraction as explained by
Newton and Leibniz, and that there was a unified system ofmovement
for the spiritual and the material world. I suspected that this analogy
could be extended to cover particular instances as well as general
laws; that the attractions and properties of animals, vegetables and
minerals might be co-ordinated on the same level as those of man
and the stars. After doing the necessary research I became con­
vinced that this was so. Thus another definitive science was dis­
covered : the analogy of the Four Movements, material, organic, animal
and social, 3 or the analogy of the modifications of matter with the math­
ematical theo�y of the passions of man and animals.
The discovery of these two definitive sciences led to my finding
others, which there would be no point in listing here. They extend
as far as literature and the arts, and will establish exact methods in
all fields of human knowledge.
As soon as I had understood the two theories of attraction and
the unity of the Four Movements, I began to decipher the book of
nature; one after another, its former mysteries were explained . I
had lifted the supposedly impenetrable veil, and now stepped for­
ward into a new scientific world. Thus it was that, step by step, I
arrived at the calculus of universal destinies, or the determination
3

(the Social or the Passional); Cardinal Movements: (the Aroma!," the Instinctual,
the Organic, the Material).

govern the sexual relations of the planets and provide the seeds of created species.)

1808 Introduction

of the fundamental system that governs the laws of all movements,
past, present and to come.
It is difficult to say what is the more surprising element in this
success, the good fortune by which these new sciences were revealed
to me, with the aid of a small calculation about association, which
is the key to them, or the stupidity of the scientists of twenty-five
centuries who never thought of concerning themselves with this
calculus, despite all the other fields in which they exhausted them­
selves. I believe the choice must be made in my favour, and that
the extent of my discoveries will seem less surprising than the stu­
pidity of the centuries who failed to make them.
However I have already consoled the scientists for their disgrace
by showing them that a harvest of glory and riches awaits them all:
I bring more new sciences than there were gold mines in the newly
discovered Americas. But not having the knowledge needed to
develop all, I shall take only one for myself, that of Social Movement,
and leave all the rest to provide a rich field for other learned
thinkers.
They certainly need some new source of nourishment! All classes
of thinkers are in dire straits, reduced to impoverished gleanings.
The known sciences have been worked and reworked down to the
last grain; there is nothing left for them to do except create soph­
istical arguments, filling twice the number of volumes by first rais­
ing then refuting each error.
From now on, the scene is changed. Scholars will move from
absolute privation to excessive opulence; the harvest will be so copi­
ous that they can all think they are sharing in it, and can all establish
colossal reputations for themselves, because they will be the first to
exploit this mine of scientific ideas, and they will seize the richest
veins. When I produce the second treatise, dealing with

animal and

organic movements, they will each glimpse subjects on which they
will be able to compose treatises of definitive science. I stress the
term Definitive Science, because there is no shortage of vague and
whimsical sciences in this area, such as botany, the different systems
of which are merely arbitrarily classified tables; they bear no relation
to the method of nature, which is to co-ordinate all the forms and
properties of created things with a common type, in the mathemat­
ical system of human passions.

The Theory of the Four Movements
I have provided a glimpse of the way in which the sciences will
eventually adopt a constant procedure, and share a single unvarying
method. In the second treatise I shall give some idea of this method
which connects everything with our passions. It demonstrates in
tabular form the operation of the passions in everything that exists,
and this analogy will give to the most pedestrian subjects, such as
anatomy, greater charm than the study of flowers offers today.
First among the many fortunate results which this method will
yield will be the discovery of specific cures for all types of illness.
Every ill has one or more antidotes drawn from the three kingdoms,
but medicine has lacked a regular theory which would enable it to
search systematically for unknown remedies, and it has therefore
been obliged to stumble along for centuries, indeed for millennia,
until cures are revealed by chance. This is why it has still not found
natural absorbents for plague, rabies or gout: these will be dis­
covered by means of the theory of the Four Movements. Thus
medicine, like the other sciences, will emerge from its long infancy
and, through the calculus of counter-movements achieve all of the
knowledge which has for so long been refused it.
How reason is misled by the inexact sciences

Scientific knowledge and fame are desirable aims, no doubt, but
inadequate unless they are accompanied by fortune. Understanding,
prizes and other such illusory rewards do not lead to happiness,
which consists primarily in the possession of wealth. This is why
scholars, being poor, are generally unhappy in Civilisation. They
will only enjoy the favours of fortune in the societary order which
will succeed Civilisation: in the new social state all artists and schol­
ars of real merit will become colossally rich. I shall explain later
the way in which the merits of various works will be established
by the annual vote of all the cantons in the world.
But besides showing the arts and the definitive sciences the brilli­
ant career that is opening up for them, how can I find words power­
ful enough to express the storm that will strike those old idols of
Civilisation, the uncertain sciences? Need I dress in black from head
to foot to tell politicians and moralists that the fatal hour has struck,
and that the great galleries of their works are about to sink into
the void, that Plato, Seneca, Rousseau, Voltaire and every other
18

I8o8 Introduction

coryphaeus of ancient or modern inexactitude are all destined for
the stream of oblivion? (I am not speaking of their literary pro­
ductions, only the works concerned with politics and ethics. )
This collapse o f libraries and reputations will not d o any harm
to the body of philosophy, given that its most famous writers are
no longer alive and will not have to put up with the ignominy of
their eclipse. And those of their disciples who are still living need
only think of the fortune that awaits them, and of the pleasure of
finally penetrating into the sanctuary of nature which their prede­
cessors were unable to do.
Have they not always, indeed, foreseen the thunderbolt that
threatened them? I find it foreshadowed in their most renowned
works, from Socrates who hoped that enlightenment would one day
descend, to Voltaire who, impatient to see it, cries, 'In how thick night
nature remains veiled!'4 All admit the uselessness of their sciences and
the misdirection of the reason they claimed to be perfecting. In the
end, they all seem to agree with what their anthologist, Anacharsis,
says: 'These libraries that claim to be treasuries of sublime knowledge
are j ust a humiliating accumulation of error and contradiction. ' 5
This is only too true; throughout all the twenty-five centuries for
which the moral and political sciences have existed, they have done
nothing for the happiness of humanity. They have served only to
increase human wickedness through progressive scientific schemes of
reform, all of which have ended up perpetuating poverty and betrayal,
merely reproducing the same scourges in different forms. After so
many fruitless attempts to ameliorate the social order, philosophers
are left with nothing but confusion and despair. For them, the prob­
lem of public happiness is an insurmountable obstacle: for is not the
mere sight of the poor who fill our cities proof enough that these cas­
cades of philosophical enlightenment are really only torrents of
darkness?
Nonetheless, a universal unrest bears witness that the human race
has not yet arrived at the point to which nature wishes it to come, and
this unrest seems to presage some great upheaval which will change
our destiny. Nations suffering from misery grasp enthusiastically at
any political or religious dream which offers them a glimpse of well4

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
being; they are like somebody who is desperately ill relying upon a
miracle cure. It is as if nature were whispering in the ear of human­
kind that there is happiness reserved for it, although the way to it is
still unknown, and that a marvellous discovery will suddenly be made
that will dispel the darkness of Civilisation.
For all its vaunted progress, reason has contributed nothing to
happiness as long as it has not procured social man the fortune
which is the object of all his wishes; by social fortune I mean a
progressive degree of wealth which protects the least well-off from
need and ensures them, as a minimum, the fate we currently call a
bourgeois competence. Since it is undeniable that, after health, wealth
is the principal source of happiness for social man, reason, which
has been unable to provide us with relative wealth or degrees of
comfort, has clearly achieved nothing by its pompous theories
except pointless quantities of useless verbiage. And my own dis­
covery would be no more than a new disgrace to reason if it were
only to provide us with yet more science, without also giving us the
wealth which must precede it.
The theory of the destinies will fulfil the desires of nations by
ensuring that everybody's desire for at least a modicum of wealth
is satisfied, a state of affairs which will only come about through
the order of the progressive Series. As for the Civilisation from
which we are about to emerge, I shall demonstrate that, far from
being man's industrial destiny, it is merely a passing scourge with
which most worlds are afflicted in their early stages; it is a tempor­
ary sickness of the human race, like teething in infancy. It has been
prolonged 2,300 years too long, because of the inattention or pride
of the philosophers, who have disdained any study of association
and attraction . And I shall show that savage, patriarchal, barbaric
and civilised society are just thorny paths, ladders by which we
ascend to a better social order, the order of progressive Series which
is man's industrial destiny, outside which all the efforts of the best
princes are quite incapable of remedying the miseries of peoples.
It is therefore in vain, philosophers, that you have amassed librar­
ies in order to search for happiness if you have not also completely
uprooted all social evils, by which I mean industrial incoherence
which is the antithesis of God's intended designs . You complain
that nature withholds knowledge of her laws; but if you have not
been able to discover them so far, is it not about time you acknowl20

1808 Introduction

edged the inadequacy of your methods and set about looking for
new ones? Either nature does not intend men to be happy, or nature
rejects your methods because they have not been able to prise her
secrets from her. Nature is not so hostile to the efforts of physicists
as to yours! Because physicists study the laws of nature instead of
trying to dictate them, whereas all you study is the art of stifling
nature's own voice, stifling attraction which is the interpreter of
nature, because all aspects of it lead to the formation of progressive
Series. What a contrast there is, then, between your blunders and
the great achievements of the definitive sciences. Every day you pile
new errors on top of old ones, while every day we see the physical
sciences advancing down the road to truth, and shedding over the
modern age a lustre equal to the disgrace your visions have
imprinted for ever upon the eighteenth century.
We are going to be witness to a spectacle which can only be
seen once in each globe, the transition from incoherence to social
combination. This is the most brilliant movement that can ever
happen in the universe, and the anticipation of it shall be a conso­
lation to the present generation for all its miseries. Every year of
this period of metamorphosis will be worth centuries of ordinary
existence, and will provide a host of such surprising events that it
would be inappropriate for me to provide even a glimpse of them
without proper preparation. This is why I have decided to postpone
the theory of the combined order, or progressive Series, to the third
treatise, and for the time being to put forward only the general
results, such as the spontaneous accession of savages to industry,
the espousal by Barbarians of the liberation of women and slaves,
whose freedom is necessary for the formation of progressive Series,
and the establishment of unity over the whole world in areas like
language, weights and measures, typography and other functions.
As for the details of the societary order, and the pleasures it will
bring us, I must, I repeat, be careful how much of these I announce
to civilised people. Demoralised by constant misery and by philo­
sophical prejudices, they have come to believe that God has des­
tined them to suffering, or at best to only moderate happiness; they
will not be able to get used immediately to the idea of the well-being
in store for them, and they will become too excited if, without any
precautions, they are shown all the delights they will so soon be
able to enjoy, as it will take scarcely two years to organise each
21

The Theory of the Four Movements
societary canton, and scarcely six years to complete the organisation
of the entire globe, making maximum allowance for possible delays.
The combined order will from the outset be as brilliant as it has
been long deferred. Greece, in the century of Solon, was already in
a position to undertake it, having a degree of luxury sufficient to
proceed to this form of organisation; today, however, our capacity
for luxury and refinement is at least double what it was among the
Athenians (who had no sprung carriages, no linen, cotton or silk, no
sugar or other produce of America and the Orient, nor the compass,
telescope and other modern scientific inventions: it is therefore no
exaggeration when I say that our resources of pleasure and luxury
are at least twice as great). We shall commence the combined order
with all the more intensity, and we shall then be able to gather
the fruits of eighteenth-century progress in the physical sciences,
successes which hitherto have been unproductive. Throughout
Civilisation our scientific marvels have been catastrophic rather than
conducive to happiness because by augmenting the means of pleas­
ure they have augmented the privations of the great number who
lacked the barest necessities; they have added very little except some
more variety to the pleasures of the great, who were already sur­
feited, and they have encouraged more and more corruption by
multiplying the rewards available to cupidity.
Hitherto the improvements the sciences have made in luxury
have operated to the profit of the dishonest, who are more likely to
become rich in barbaric and civilised society than truthful men.
This strange fact leads us to opt for one of two possible interpret­
ations: either God or Civilisation is maleficent. Only the latter can
be rationally entertained, as it is not possible to suppose God to be
maleficent; although indeed he would be if he had condemned us
to vegetate for ever in the disastrous state of Civilisation.
Instead of looking at the problem in this light, the philosophers
have tried to evade the question of human wickedness, the problem
that leads us to question either Civilisation or God. Together, they
shared a bastard opinion, atheism, which by assuming the absence
of a God, releases thinkers from any obligation to seek out his views,
and authorises them to put forward their own capricious and incom­
patible theories as arbiters of good and evil. Atheism is a very con­
venient opinion for those who are morally and politically ignorant,
and those who have been called strong-minded for their profession
22

I8o8 Introduction

of atheism have actually thereby shown themselves to be mentally
weak. Fearing failure in their attempts to discover God's intentions
for the social order, they preferred to deny the existence of God,
and hold up as perfect the civilised order which in secret they
detested and whose appearance disorients them to the point where
they doubt Providence.
It is not only the philosophers who are at fault here. While it is
absurd not to believe in God, it is equally absurd to half-believe in
him, to think that his providence is only partial, that he has neg­
lected to provide for our most urgent needs, such as a social order
designed to make us happy. When one considers the marvels of our
industry, such as tall ships, and many other wonders which appear
premature in relation to our political infancy, how can one believe
that the God who has so liberally bestowed so much sublime know­
ledge would want to refuse us knowledge of the social art, without
which all the others are worthless? Would God not indeed be
blameworthy and illogical if he had initiated us into so many noble
sciences without ever intending them to do anything except produce
a disgusting and vicious society such as Civilisation?
General predispositions of Civilised Man

When I reveal the invention which will deliver the human race from
civilised chaos, barbarism and savagery, ensure it more happiness
than it ever dared dream of and open up the realm of nature's
mysteries from which it thought it was for ever excluded, the multi­
tude will be bound to accuse me of charlatanism and wise men will
think they are being restrained in regarding me merely as a vision­
ary. Without being sidetracked by such minor attacks, which all
discoverers have to expect, I shall try to predispose the reader to be
impartial.
Why were the most famous discoverers, like Galileo, Columbus
and many others, persecuted or ridiculed before they were listened
to? For two main reasons, general adversity and scientific pride.
I . General Adversity. If an invention brings with it a promise of
happiness, people are afraid to accede to such an improbable hope
of good. The tendency is to reject a viewpoint which will rearouse
smouldering desires and make present sufferings feel harsher in
.
contrast with promises of a brilliant future. Thus when a poor man
23

The Theory of the Four Movements
unexpectedly inherits a fortune he refuses to believe the first
announcement of it, dismisses the bearer of the happy news and
accuses him of mocking his poverty.
This is the first obstacle I shall encounter when I announce to
the human race that they are all about to pass into a state of great
happiness, all hope of which has been lost during five millennia of
seemingly irremediable social misery. I would find more of a wel­
come if I proclaimed only moderate well-being, which is in fact why
I have decided to give only a severely curtailed picture of the happi­
ness to come. When its full extent becomes known, people will be
amazed that I had the patience to delay and defer publication, and
that I could remain so contained and write so coolly about the
events to come which would arouse so much enthusiasm.
2 . Scientific Pride will be the second obstacle I shall have to fight.
Every really brilliant invention arouses jealousy in those who might
have thought of it themselves. There is indignation when an
unknown is suddenly raised by chance to the pinnacle of fame; they
do not easily forgive a contemporary for penetrating mysteries that
anybody else could have penetrated before him, nor for eclipsing all
accepted knowledge at a stroke, and leaving the most illustrious
scientists and thinkers far behind. Such success becomes an affront
to the existing generation. The benefits the discovery will bring are
forgotten in the confusion into which it throws the century that
failed to make it; and rather than think rationally about it, every­
body wants to avenge his wounded vanity. That is why they ridicule
the author of a brilliant discovery, and persecute him, before they
have examined and assessed it.
A Newton suffers little from this sort of jealousy because his
calculations are so complex that the mass of scientists cannot claim
to understand them; but a Columbus is violently attacked because
the idea of looking for a new continent is so simple that anybody
might have thought of it. Then they try to stand in the way of the
inventor and prevent him from trying out his ideas. Let me give an
example to illustrate the general ill-will that civilised man shows
towards discoverers.
An ignorant pope threw all the thunderbolts of the Church and
public opinion in the path of Columbus, and yet was it not in his
interest, more than any other's, to see Columbus' plan succeed?
There is no doubt that it was, for no sooner was America discovered

1808 Introduction

than the pontiff distributed empires in the new world, and found it
highly convenient to profit from a discovery the mere idea of which
had aroused his utter wrath. This illogicality in the head of the
Church is typical of all men: their prejudices and vanity blind them
to their self-interest. If he had thought rationally he would have
realised that the Holy See, being able at that period to distribute
temporal sovereignty over unknown lands and bring them within
its religious empire, had every interest in encouraging the search
for a new continent. But the pope and his council were too vain to
think rationally. This kind of small-mindedness is common to all
centuries and all individuals. It is a difficulty that dogs every inven­
tor, who must expect to be persecuted in proportion to the mag­
nificence of his discovery, particularly if he is a complete unknown,
with no earlier work on the knowledge to which chance has pro­
vided him with the key to recommend him.
[If I were dealing with an impartial century which sincerely
attempted to plumb the mysteries of nature it would be easy to
demonstrate that the Newtonians had only half-explained the laws
of the branch of movement they dealt with, the siderea/. 6
Indeed they would have nothing to say in answer to questions
about the distributive system of the stars; their most learned suc­
cessor, Laplace, could not begin to solve the following problems:
What are the rules governing sidereal arrangement, the ranks
and positions assigned to the planets?
Why is Mercury the first?
Why is Herschel, 7 which is so far from the sun, smaller than
Saturn? And should Jupiter not be closer to the centre?
What causes the different degrees of eccentricity of their orbits?
What are the rules governing accolade and conjugation?
Why do some planets both behave as conjugate moons and obey
the pivotal orbit, like the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and
Herschel?

25

The Theory of the Four Movements
Why do others, like Venus, Mars, etc., move in a free orbit?
Why does Herschel have eight moons when it is sixteen times
smaller than Jupiter, which only has four? Ought not the
giant Jupiter to have the larger number of moons? In terms
of size, it could control sixteen more than Herschel. This
distribution runs curiously contrary to the theorem of the
direct attraction of masses.
Given this theorem, why does Jupiter, with its huge mass, not
attract and join with the four small planets, Juno, Ceres,
Pallas and Vesta, which are so close to it? If it joined up
with them it would still only have eight moons, like the
sixteen-times-smaller Herschel; it would still be a very small
burden to bear.
Why does Saturn have rings of light and Jupiter not, even
though Saturn receives more light from its seven moons
than Jupiter does from its four?
Why does the Earth have a moon and not Venus?
Why does our moon, Phoebe, not have an atmosphere as Venus
has and we have?
What is the functional difference between the conjugate planets
or satellites, like Phoebe, the conjugant or moon-owning
planets, like the Earth and Jupiter, and the isolated planets
like Venus, Mars, Mercury and Vesta?
What changes has the distributive system of the planets under­
gone, and what changes will it undergo in the future?
What are the unknown planets? Where are they positioned?
Where should we look for them? What size are they, and
what are they for?
Faced with twenty pages of similar questions our scholars wiJJ have
nothing to say; they thus have no idea about distributive questions,
and are ignorant of the greater part of the laws of sidereal motion
which they flatter themselves they have explained.
Whereas I who, since my discoveries in 1 8 1 4, have pertinent
answers to all these questions, have surely completed the task that
the Newtonians began and left unfinished.
26

1808 Introduction

The complete understanding of sidereal theory still only accounts
for one branch of the laws of Universal Movement. Among others,
we still require an explanation of the branch dealing with Passionate
or Social Movement, on which depends the unitary organisation of
the human race, its advent to Social Destiny; and the only way to
discover this is by studying the laws of Movement, of which the
Newtonians have grasped a mere fragment, and that one which is
of little use for the pursuit of happiness.
Having produced this general theory of Movement, I would need
the support of a great name to ensure its analysis and acceptance.
If it were Newton or one of his rivals or successors, like Leibniz
or Laplace, who announced the Theory of Passionate Attraction,
there would be no problems; everybody would see from the title
itself that it was a perfectly natural extension of his discoveries in
the realm of Material Attraction, a consequence of the Unity of the
universe by virtue of which the whole principle of material harmony
must be applicable to the passionate or social theory. As soon as the
announcement was made by a Newton, or by a figure of comparable
reputation, all the critics would applaud the inventor, singing the
praises of his achievement before it was even debated. But when
the discovery is the work of an unknown, a provincial, a scientific
pariah, one of those intruders who, like Piron, 8 has made the mis­
take of not even being an academician, it is bound to run up against
all the anathemas of the cabal.]
Christopher Columbus, in the example I gave above, was ridi­
culed, denounced and excommunicated for seven years for pro­
claiming the existence of a new continental world; should I not
expect the same disgraces for proclaiming a new social world? One
cannot stand out against public opinion with impunity, and the
reigning philosophy of the nineteenth century will raise more preju­
diced objections against me than were brought against Columbus
in the fourteenth century by superstition. Yet if he found in
Ferdinand and Isabella sovereigns who were wiser and less preju­
diced than all the great minds of their century, may I not also count
upon the support of a sovereign who is more dear-sighted than his

Alexis Piron ( 1 689-1773), poet and dramatist of provincial origin, best known for
his caustic wit and epigrams, made a number of enemies who, after his election
to the Academic fran�ise, persuaded Louis XV not to ratify the decision. His
most famous line was that despite his literary talent he was pas meme academicien.

The Theory of the Four Movements
contemporaries? And while the sophists of the nineteenth century
repeat, with those of the fourteenth, that there is nothing left to be
discovered, may not one potentate perhaps wish to make the same
trial as the monarchs of Castille? They did not risk much in sending
out a ship on the off-chance that it might discover a new world
and bring them an empire. A nineteenth-century sovereign might
similarly say, 'Let us set aside a square league of land to try out
agricultural association; it is little enough to risk for the chance of
raising mankind out of social chaos, ascending to the throne of uni­
versal unity and passing the sceptre of the world to our descendants
in perpetuity. '
B y indicating the prejudices that general adversity and scientific
pride will bring to bear against me, I hope to have warned the
reader against the sarcasm of the multitude who make categorical
assertions about matters on which they are ignorant and who
respond to reason with jokes and puns, the mania for which has now
reached all classes and made mockery a widespread habit. When
the proofs of my discovery are available and the moment visibly
approaches for its fruits to be enjoyed, when universal unity is
poised to rise above the ruins of barbarism and Civilisation, the
critics will rapidly switch from contempt to total enthusiasm. They
will want to make a demi-god of the inventor, and will debase them
as much by this excess of adulation as earlier they did with their
thoughtless mockery.
There is also a very small number of impartial men. I admire
their distrust and indeed I hope to arouse it by asking them to
suspend their judgement until I've dealt with the mechanism of the
progressive Series. The first two treatises will not be concerned
with this issue, their only aim being to prepare the way, and to
familiarise the human mind with the excess of happiness in store.

Plan
In these two treatises, I shall talk about the following topics:
What are the destinies? What different branches make up the whole
system? What indications and methods did the human mind need in
order to arrive at the discovery of the general system of the destinies?

I shall not separate these questions, as it would be hard for me to
treat them in isolation. There is a lot of repetition in this book, and
perhaps there ought to be more, to sustain attention to a subject so
new and so opposed to all the philosophical prejudices the world
is imbued with.
I shall divide this prospectus into three parts: Exposition, Descrip­
tions and Confirmation.
1 . The Exposition will cover some of the branches of the General
Destinies: a subject as elevated and extensive as this will not interest
the majority of readers, but it will be interspersed with enough
curious detail to compensate for some dry passages. This first part
is therefore addressed to the curious, to those studious men who are
not afraid of encountering and overcoming a few obstacles in order
to penetrate profound mysteries; they will be agreeably surprised
to find expositions in this first part of such various subjects as the
origin of societies, their future succession, and the material and
social revolutions of our globe and of other worlds.
2 . The Descriptions will make known some details about private
or domestic destinies in the combined order. They will provide
some insight into its pleasures, addressed particularly, in this con­
nection, to the Voluptuous or Sybarites. After this foretaste of the
29

The Theory of the Four Movements
delights of the combined order, they will understand how deeply
the human race has been misled by the philosophers who have
hidden the roads to this sort of happiness by their obstinate hostility
to passionate attraction and their desire to suppress or stifle it
instead of making a proper study of it.
3. The Confirmation will be made up of demonstrations of the
falsity of current knowledge. I shall expound the systematic blun­
ders of civilised man, especially the most recent one, which also
exclusively governs their politics, namely the Commercial Spirit. I
shall indicate the increased empiricism of the inexact sciences and
the revolutions which bring us more and more under their auspices.
This third part is addressed to the critics: they will recognise that
the philosophers, despite their apparent demoralisation, have a
greater and more mystificatory influence on the social body than
ever, and that the mercantile systems which are the last resort of
these sophists are the most inept idea ever and, as such, an appro­
priate conclusion to civilised absurdities.
By arranging it thus, I think I have adapted the prospectus to
suit the tastes of the different classes of readers, all of whom can
be placed in one of the three categories of Curious, Voluptuous or
Critical.
But I ask them all to remember that in a prospectus I cannot
linger over demonstrations, and that I do not expect to be believed
simply by announcing so many marvellous events and incompre­
hensible results: all I am trying to do is to arouse curiosity in the
treatises that follow, which will contain the theory demonstrating
the truth of all this. This knowledge is all the more wonderful
because it is so easy for anybody to learn it; it all stems from a
simple calculus about agricultural association, in the form ofprogress­
ive Series. Such was the modest seed of this most brilliant of dis­
coveries; j ust as great rivers often have their source in humble
springs, or avalanches that crush villages start off as the lightest
snowflake.
[Given that the most exact science, mathematics, where a thou­
sand treatises have competed for theoretical perfection, still presents
all students with difficulties and obscurities that force them to read
each text a number of times and to take lessons from an expert, it
must be expected that the study of Passionate Attraction will pose
many more obstacles, as it is a science which is still at its rudimen30

1808 Introduction

tary stage, at its dawn, and also because the following exposition
necessarily suffers from three imperfections:
1.

2.

3.

It is announced in the form of a prospectus, in terms of vague
preliminary ideas, which - even if they were perfectly clear would be insufficient to initiate readers, since I am only provid­
ing a prelude to each subject.
It has been drawn up by a man unfamiliar with the art of writ­
ing, who has not had the benefit of critical advice about the
extent of the detail it would be appropriate to provide on each
branch of the subject.
It is restricted to the elementary and incomplete understanding
the author was able to acquire between 1 799 and 1 807, which
has subsequently been greatly enhanced.

Hampered by these obstacles, I could hardly have initiated and
satisfied readers in 1 807, when they will still have need of further
lessons when I publish the Treatise in 1 82 1 , when the wits and
plagiarists will add their commentaries to it.
Looking at this prospectus now, with the advantage of ten years'
hindsight, I think, given the progress the science has made, that it
would need a commentary substantially longer than the volume
itself. So be patient until 1 82 1 ']

31

First Part
Exposition of some branches of the
general destinies
Argument

Foreseeing the criticism of dryness that may be levelled at this first
part, I have already warned that it is designed for scholarly readers,
not for the frivolous. Those who have heard stories about the pleas­
ures of the combined order may have expected to find them
depicted here, to see the progressive Series in action and read
nothing but seductive details about their domestic lives, the appetis­
ing composition of their feasts, the variety of their loves, festivals,
entertainments, adventures, travels, etc., and about the voluptuous
refinements the new order will introduce into the most insipid tasks.
Some people who have trembled with impatience at the descrip­
tion of these pleasures, unknown within Civilisation, might have

liked to insist on having a complete picture, but a balanced approach
requires that before I get down to the fine detail I first explain the
General Destinies of the planet.
Consequently I shall deal with a period of 80, 000 years,
encompassing the entire vegetal life of the globe. I shall speak about
the various creations which will follow on from that whose fruits
we now see, the next one of which will begin in four centuries. I
shall explain the physical changes this globe will undergo during
the eighty thousand years of vegetation, seventy thousand of which
will see the North Pole under full cultivation because of the shining

ring of light, or northern crown, which will appear after two centur­
ies of combined order.
At first, as I have said, the way will be thorny, but I would be
conceding too much to my critics if I proceeded without any
method just to satisfy the curious; and although all I provide here
are insights without theories, it is at least appropriate that they
should be concerned first with the globe as a whole before we con­
sider the destiny of individuals. In the course of this work various
tables will be found, the nomenclature in which may seem inappro­
priate or badly chosen, as I do not have a very good command of
the French language. You must therefore pay more attention to the
ideas than to the words, on the choice of which I confess my in­
adequacy. In this connection, I shall adopt more correct nomencla­
ture when it is communicated to me.
On exception

I must begin with this chapter in order to spare the reader from
raising an infinitude of objections later on. The calculi on attraction
and Social Movement are all subject to the exception of an eighth
or a ninth: this is always to be understood, even when I do not
mention it. For instance, if I say as a general thesis, civilised man
is very miserable, this means that seven-eighths, or eight-ninths of
them are reduced to a state of misery and privation, and that only
one-eighth escapes the general misfortune and enjoys a lot that can
be envied."
If I add that the happiness enjoyed by this small minority of
civilised people is all the more tiresome for the multitude because
most of those favoured by fortune deserve it least, this statement,
too, makes an exception of an eighth or a ninth: and one time out
of eight you will see somebody who deserves their good fortune;
this shadow of equity, however, only serves to confirm the system•

It is surely necessary for God to elevate a few individuals to the state of well-being
he denies to the great majority, and thereby to show us glimpses of the happiness
of which we are generally deprived; without this precaution the inhabitants of
civilisation would be unaware of their misery: the sight of somebody else's wealth
is the only stimulus capable of embittering scholars and thinkers, most of whom
are poor, and inciting them to look for a new social order capable of providing
civilised man with the well-being he has been deprived of.

atic injustice with which wealth is distributed in the civilised order.
I conclude that the exception of an eighth or a ninth which can
be applied to all my assertions only serves to confirm them; there
is thus no point in my mentioning the exception in every thesis,
nor in the reader raising any arguments which hinge on the points
I have just made. In order to make it easier to remember this, I
shall repeat the comment more than once.
The exception is not unalterably fixed at an eighth or a ninth; it
may vary to some extent on either side, but the eighth and ninth
are the commonest ones, and thus the ones used in the general
calculus.

General ideas about the destinies
(The next five preliminary chapters must be read at least twice, and
preferably three times, if you want fully to understand the chapters
that follow, which will not prove difficult once the first five have
been mastered. )
Definition and division

The destinies are the past, present and future results of God's
mathematical laws of universal movement.
Universal movement is divided into four main branches: social,
animal, organic and material.
1.

2.

3.
4.

Social Movement: this theory explains the laws by which God
governs the ordering and succession of the different social
mechanisms in all the inhabited globes.
Animal movement: this theory explains the laws by which God
distributes the passions and instincts of all created beings, past
and future, in the various globes.
Organic movement: this theory explains the laws by which God
distributes properties, such as form, colour, smell, etc., to all
created or future substances in the various globes.
Material movement: this theory, which has already been
explained by modern geometricians, has taught us the laws by
which God governs the gravitation of matter on the various
globes.

There is no effect of movement which is not included in one or
other of these four divisions; together they make up universal move-

First part: The general destinies
ment of which we only know about the fourth branch, material move­
ment. Even this has as yet only been partially explained, as the
geometricians, in pointing out the laws of the existing order of the
stars, fail to take account of the changes the vortices of stars under­
went a hundred thousand years ago, and the changes they may
undergo in a hundred thousand years' time. They are thus unable
to determine the past and future revolutions of the universe. The
calculations for these, which I shall bring within everybody's reach,
are part of the theory of material movement, which can now be
seen to have been only partially worked out.
Hierarchy of the four movements

I should devote a chapter to this question, but as it would not be
within the grasp of the majority of readers, I shall restrict myself
to saying something about it in the note below. b The note may be
b

The four movements are dependent on two things.
First. The laws of the four movements are co-ordinated with mathematics; without
this dependence there would be no harmony in nature, and God would be unjust.
In fact:
Nature is composed of three eternal, uncreated and indestructible principles.
I.

2.
3.

God o r Spirit, active, motive principle.
Matter, the passive, moved principle.
Justice or Mathematics, the principle governing movement.

For harmony to be established between the three principles God must be in accord
with mathematics as he moves or modifies matter; otherwise he would appear
arbitrary in his own eyes as well as ours, not being in agreement with a fixed,
independent principle of justice. However, by subordinating himself to mathemat­
ical rules he is unable to change, God creates an accord which is both to his glory
and in his interest. To his glory because he therefore rules the universe equitably
rather than arbitrarily, so that matter is moved by laws that are not subject to
change. In his interest beca use the accord with mathematics provides him with a
means of obtaining the greatest amount of effect from any movement with the
smallest outlay of energy.
We already know that the two movements, the material and the organic, are in
accord with geometry, and that all animate or inanimate bodies are constructed,
moved, or modified in accordance with its laws. So two of the four movements
are co-ordinated with natural justice and are independent of God. It remained to
be shown that the two other movements, the animal and the social, the field of
activity of the passions, follow the same rule, and that all passions, even the most
odious ones, produce effects in men and animals which are geometrically governed
by God. For instance:
The properties of friendship are modelled on those of the circle.
The properties of love are modelled on those of the ellipse.
37

The Theory of the Four Movements
skipped, as it is not necessary to read it to understand what follows,
and it will only be of interest to a small number of people.
Social movement

We have already seen how the theory of Social Movement deter­
mines the ordering and succession of all the different social mechan­
isms that can be organised in all the globes, and that it includes
past, present and future. Wits may smile ironically at this, and say,
The properties of paternity are modelled on those of the parabola.
The properties of ambition are modelled on those of the hyperbola.
And the collective properties of these four passions are modelled on those of the
cycloid.
Each geometrical theorem thus serves as the pattern for some passion of man
or the animals, and this passion invariably retains its relations with the theorem
which governs its creation. The passionate series or grouped series are based on
the properties and order of geometric series, as in Note A.
Second dependence. The social movement is the pattern for the three others. The
animal, organic and material movements are co--0rdinated with the social move­
ment, which is primary. This means that the properties of an animal, a vegetable,
a mineral, or even a vortex of stars represent an effect of the human passions in
the social order, and that everything, from atoms to stars, is an image of the
properties of the human passions. For instance:
The
The

The

groups
groups

groups

of stars in the milky way represent the properties of friendship.
of solar planets represent the properties of love.
of planetary satellites represent the properties of paternity.
of suns or fixed stars represent the properties of ambition.

This means that our passions, which have been treated so disparagingly by the
philosophers, actually play the most important part, after God, in the movement
of the universe. After God, they are the most noble things in the universe, because
it was his wish that the whole universe should be organised in the image of the
effects they produce in the social movement.
It follows from this that if a globe achieves an understanding of the laws of
social movement, it simultaneously discovers the laws of the other movements,
because they are in all respects its hieroglyphs. Thus, if we did not yet understand
the laws of material movement which modern geometricians have in fact estab­
lished, we could now discover them by their analogy with the laws of social move­
ment, which I have discovered, and which provide the key to the whole system
of the other three movements. It is unfortunate for the human race that scholars
began their studies at the point where they should have ended them, with the
laws of material movement, as these are the most difficult to establish, and the
knowledge of them does not make understanding the other three classes of laws
any easier.
This is a very inadequate note, admittedly, but it would not be appropriate to
go into more detail in an outline sketch of this kind.

First part: The general destinies
'So you are going to tell us about what goes on in other worlds, in
the Sun, the Moon, Jupiter, Sirius, the Milky Way and all the other
stars!' Yes, indeed I am, and furthermore tell you what has hap­
pened there in the past and what will happen there in the centuries
to come. The destinies cannot be read only in part; one cannot
establish the destinies of one world without possessing a calculus
which reveals the destinies of them all.
You may think that a knowledge of the fate of other globes is no
concern of yours, but it will be demonstrated by the laws of move­
ment that your souls will traverse these globes for eternity, and that
the eternal bliss which religions give you cause to hope for will
depend on the well-being of the other globes in which your souls
will rejoin the material world after having spent 80,000 years on
the one we currently inhabit.
You will therefore come to know the social mechanisms that reign
on the other stars, the fortunate or unfortunate revolutions to which
their inhabitants are subject. You will learn that our little globe has,
for the last five or six thousand years, been in the most wretched
state a world can find itself in. But the calculus which will reveal
the happiness enjoyed by people on other stars will also give you
the means of introducing on your own globe a state of happiness
akin to that of more fortunate worlds.
I move on now to an outline of the social revolutions which our
own has to undergo.

Here you will learn an extremely important truth, namely that the
ages of happiness last seven times longer than the ages of unhap­
piness, like the one we have been living in for several thousand
years. This might seem irrelevant to anybody who is alive in a
period of unhappiness, but the theory of Social Movement will
show that in future ages your souls will participate in some way in
the fate of the living. For 70,000 years, therefore, you will share in
the happiness which is in store for the globe; so you should take
an interest in this outline of the future revolutions which your
planet will undergo.
The human race will continue to exist for approximately 80,000
years. This number is estimated to within one-eighth, like all the
calculations about Social Movement. This 80,000-year social pro­
cess is divided into four phases, and subdivided into thirty-two
periods. These I shall tabulate: they need to be studied carefully,
fully understood and retained in the memory.
Phases

There are: Two phases of ascending vibration or gradation.
Two phases of descending vibration or degradation.

The two phases of incoherence or social discord comprise the per­
iods of unhappiness.
The two phases of combination or social unity comprise the ages
of happiness, which will last for seven times as long as the ages of
unhappiness.
From this outline it can be seen that the periods of suffering, for
the human race as for individuals, are at the two extremes.
We are in the first phase, in the age of ascending incoherence which
precedes arrival at the destinies. That is why we have been excess­
ively unhappy for five or six thousand years, the history of which
has been chronicled. Hardly seven thousand years have elapsed
since the creation of men, and for all that time we have gone from
one torment to the next.
The immensity of our suffering can only be assessed when one
understands the excess of happiness in store for us, to which state
we shall rapidly pass, thanks to the discovery of the laws of move­
ment. We shall then be in the second phase, ascending combination.
The two phases of incoherence, although very short, each contain
seven Social Periods, in all:
14 periods of incoherence

The two phases of combination, although very long, each contain
only nine Social Periods, in all:
I 8 periods of combination
Total: 32 periods or societies
There is a total of thirty-two possible periods or societies, not
counting the overlaps.

The Theory of the Four Movements
Overleaf is a diagram of these thirty-two periods. It may seem
exhausting to commit them to memory, but is there any area of
knowledge which does not require some preliminary study? Why
should the calculus of the destinies not have its thorny parts?
It is important to read and re-read this diagram in order not to have
to turn back to it every time I speak of the various phases and periods.
Those who are unwilling to devote a quarter of an hour to studying
these tables and comparing the four phases and the thirty-two social
metamorphoses with the epochs of the eighteen creations and the northern
crown should shut the book rather than continue reading something
which will constantly present them with obscurities, although to anybody
who has studied these tables of Social Movement they will be quite
intelligible.
Looking at the tables one is first of all struck by the small­
mindedness of the philosophers who argue that Civilisation is the
final stage of social destiny, whereas it is only the fifth of the thirty­
two possible societies, and one of the most wretched of the ten
periods of unhappiness, which are: .
The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th in the phase of infancy.
The 3 1 st, 30th, 29th, 28th and 27th in the phase of
decrepitude.
I call these periods of unhappiness because there is no happiness
except in those whose mechanism is formed into grouped Series and
not into isolated households.
The periods 1 and 32, 7 and 26 are formed into Series, but of a
hybrid sort. The seventh and twenty-sixth are embryonic forms of
grouped Series, organised in instances where the human race lacks
the calculus of association and only discovers the seeds of the idea.
These hybrid Series are nonetheless very happy: I shall give some
account of them in the second part, which will deal with the pro­
gressive household.
The human race is about to raise itself to the eighth social period
(Simple Combined Series) which will become established over the
whole globe, and which will last at least four hundred years before
it will be possible to pass on to the ninth . This will only be organ­
ised with the help of new creations and of the northern crown,
which I shall talk about later.

42

First part: The general destinies
During its first phase, the Social Movement looks rather like a
man retreating a few steps when he comes to a ditch so that he will
be better able to j ump over it: I have represented this on the dia­
gram by the words retreat, run-up and leap. It is retreat to fall from
the first period, which is happy, to the fourth, which is the most
unhappy; but it is there that the new force, large-scale agricultural
and manufacturing industry, is acquired, which by increasing during
the run-up periods 5, 6 and 7 finally gives the human race the
means of leaping from chaos into harmony.
The thirty-two societies should not be counted as sixteen, even
though they are recreated in reverse order in the two latter phases,
because in their new form they undergo major changes. For
example when Civilisation is recreated, at the decline of the world,
it will be as peaceful as it is turbulent today when it has all the
impetuosity of youth. This latter-day Civilisation will be tempered
by the knowledge of lost happiness and by the sorrow of being
unable to recreate progressive Series. The mechanism of these will
be shackled, disorganised and dissolved by the eighteenth and last
creation, which will be as pernicious as the one we see around us
today.
The first phase, or infancy, is the only one whose duration is
not fixed, and whose course is irregular: it ought to be limited
to five thousand years, but God having given us freewill cannot
prevent some globes from being led astray by the inexact sciences
and the widespread prejudices they induce against nature and
attraction. The globes that are encrusted with philosophy may
persist in their blindness for a long time, believing themselves
skilled in the social art, when in fact they know only how to
produce revolutions, poverty, dishonesty and carnage. They are
so stubborn in their pride, and reason is so little raised against
the false savants, that it is no wonder disorder is perpetuated;
and where can you find more appalling disorder than that which
reigns on this globe? Half the earth is invaded by ferocious or
wild beasts, while three-quarters of the half under cultivation is
occupied by headsmen or barbarians who enslave the farmers and
the women and who are, in every respect, an affront to reason.
There thus remains an eighth of the globe given over to those
accomplished brigands, civilised people, who boast of perfection

43

The Theory of the Four Movements
while at the same time increasing poverty and corruption to the
highest degree; could any worse disorder be found on any other
globe? And when one sees nations welcome the philosophy which
has caused so much political chaos, is it surprising that the
human race is several thousand years behind in its social progress,
that it has spent 7,000 years in an infancy which ought scarcely
to last 5,000, and that it has only reached the fifth of the seven
periods of social infancy, without even reaching the sixth in
which it would have found at least a shadow of well-being?
The Social Movement will progress uninterruptedly in the two
ages of ascending and descending combination which will soon begin,
and which will take about 70, 000 years. In the course of this long
age of happiness, the sixteen social metamorphoses or changes of
period will be determined by the new creations which will regularly
follow on from each other, and by providing new products in the
three reigns will cause consequent modifications in social relations.
These changes, however, will be merely variations of pleasure, never
disastrous revolutions, except for the transition from the twenty­
fourth to the twenty-fifth period, which will bring about a rapid
decline and announce the decrepitude of the globe.
For the rest, just as a child of between six and seven years old
has no need to worry about the infirmities which will afflict him as
he approaches the age of eighty, so we need think of nothing but
our approaching happiness, a happiness of which the world has
never been so much in need.
Notice

On subversive anterior creation, designed for the use of the first phase
and of the eighth period which opens the second phase.
The creation whose results we see around us is the first of the
eighteen which must take place during the social progress of the
human race. I am speaking here only of the creation of the sub­
stances of the three reigns, and not of the creation of the globe
itself.
The earth took about 450 years to engender the productions of
the three reigns on the old world. The creations of America only
happened later, and took place on a different level, causing large­
scale upheavals in each continent.
44

First part: The general destinies
Creation is a pleasure for God in itself, and it is in his interest
to prolong it. As the period of human conception, gestation and
childbirth lasts for nine months, God must have taken a pro­
portional amount of time to create the three reigns: the theory
assesses the time as the one hundred and ninety-second part of the
whole course of social existence, which gives approximately 450
years as the duration of the first creation.
All creation works by the conjunction of the northern or boreal
fluid, which is male, with the southern fluid, which is female.c A
planet is a being which has two souls and two sexes, and which
procreates like animal or vegetable beings by the meeting of the two
generative substances. The process is the same throughout nature,
apart from a few variations, for planets like plants unite both sexes
in one individual.
To think that the earth will not produce new creations, and that
it is restricted to those we see around us, would be like thinking
that a woman who has had one child cannot have a second or a
third or a tenth. The earth too can bring forth a succession of
creations, but the sixteen harmonic creations will be as easy for it
as the two subversive ones, the first and the eighteenth, were and
will be exhaustingly difficult.
On each globe the first and last creations are organised in relation
to a system which is contrary to that governing the intermediate
creations, as a result of which they produce a great number of harm­
ful things and very few useful ones. The opposite is the case in all
intermediate or harmonic creations, which provide an abundance of
brilliant or useful creatures, then a very small number - an eighth of useless ones, and nothing harmful at all.
So the first crea ti on , the results of which we see around us, filled
land and sea with an immense quantity of harmful animals. Anyone
who believes in demons must surely believe that hell presided over
this creation when they see Moloch and Belial incarnate in the guise
of tigers or apes. And what could hell in its fury invent that would
be worse than rattle-snakes, bed-bugs, the legions of insects and
reptiles, sea-monsters, poisons, plague, rabies, leprosy, venereal dis' [Planets can copulate: 1 st with themselves by means of the north and south poles,

45

The Theory of the Four Movements
ease, gout and all the deadly poisons thought up to torment man
and turn this globe into a foretaste of hell? I have already pointed
out in an earlier note (in the section on the 'hierarchy of the Four
Movements') the causes of the evil system that governed the first
creation. I said there 'that the effects of the three movements, animal,
organic and material, represent the operation of human passions in the
social order' . So because the first creation had to set the scene for
the seven periods of human infancy, which is what it was created
for, God had to use it to depict, by means of horrible creatures, the
terrible results that our passions would produce during those seven
periods. And as a few virtues would have to prevail during the first
and seventh periods, God had to depict them by creating some
useful or graceful creatures, though there are very few of them in
the three reigns of this truly demonic creation. We shall see below
what sort of creatures future creations will produce in the seas and
on land; at present we scarcely know how to make use of what little
good the first creation has provided, to prove which I shall take the
cases of four quadrupeds, the vicufia, the reindeer, the zebra and
the beaver. We are deprived of the first two by our incompetence,
our malice and our dishonesty, obstacles which prevent us raising
herds of reindeer or vicufia in all the high mountain ranges capable
of sustaining these animals. Other social vices deprive us of the
beaver, whose wool is no less valuable than the vicufia's, and the
zebra which is as valuable as the horse in terms of its speed, strength
and beauty. Both our stables and our social customs are governed
by a brusqueness and disharmony which stand in the way of the
procedures necessary for the domestication of these animals. In the
eighth period, and even indeed in the seventh, we shall see quaggas
and zebras in the domestic state j ust as we now see horses and
donkeys; beavers will build their dams and establish their republics
in the most populous of cantons, flocks of vicufia will be as common
in the mountains as flocks of sheep are now, and any number of
other animals, such as ostriches, fallow-deer, jerboa, etc . , will
become friendly with man when they find him enticing enough to
remain near him, which will never happen in the civilised order.
This creation, which is already wretched and pernicious enough, is
doubly wretched for us who, because of social disharmony, are
deprived of most of the good things the three reigns could offer us.
The new creations cannot begin before the human race has
organised the eighth social period; until then, for as long as the

First part: The general destinies
first seven societies endure, we shall not see the second creation
commence.
Yet the earth is in violent upheaval with the need to create. This
can be seen from the frequent appearances of the aurora .borealis,
which are a symptom of the planet's being in rut, a useless effusion
of creative fluid, which cannot conjoin with the southern fluid as
long as the human race has not carried out its preparations, and
these can only be put into effect by the eighth society when it has
been established. First the numbers of the human race will have to
be increased to a minimum of two thousand million, which will take
at least a century, because women are much less fertile in the com­
bined order than they are in Civilisation. There household life
makes them procreate legions of children; poverty devours a third
of these, and another third is carried off by the numerous illnesses
children succumb to in the incoherent order: it would be far better
to produce fewer and keep them, but this is impossible for civilised
people, which is why they cannot cultivate the globe, and why,
despite their frightening rate of pullulation, there are only enough
of them to deal with the land they presently occupy.
When the two thousand million inhabitants have cultivated the
globe as far as the sixty-fifth parallel, they will see the formation of
the northern crown, which I shall speak about below, which will
bring light and heat to the glacial arctic regions. With this new land
brought into culti vation the human race will be able to achieve its
full complement of three thousand million. Then both continents
will be fully cultivated, and there will no longer be any obstacle to
the harmonic creations, the first of which will begin about four
centuries after the establishment of the combined order.
N orthem crown

This chapter is interesting rather than necessary; it may be skipped,
and the reader may go on to the following sections, in which I deal
with periods 2, 3, 4 and 5, and which contain details more readily
accessible to the general reader.
When the human race has extended the cultivation of the globe
beyond sixty degrees north, the planet's temperature will be less
extreme and generally much more pleasant; the rutting will become
more active, the aurora borealis will occur more frequently, will be
fixed over the pole and will broaden out into a ring or crown. The
47

The Theory of the Four Movements
fluid, which at the moment only emits light, will acquire an
additional characteristic and distribute heat as well as light.
The crown will be large enough for some point always to be in
contact with the sun, whose rays will be necessary to ignite the
outside edge of the ring; it must therefore always be able to present
an arc to the sun even when the earth's axis is at its greatest
inclination.
The influence of the northern crown will be powerful enough to
be felt across a third of the hemisphere; it will be visible in St
Petersburg, Okhotsk and along the entire sixtieth parallel. The heat,
which will increase, will be felt from there to the pole, which will
enjoy the sort of temperatures currently characteristic of Andalucia
or Sicily. The entire world will by then be under cultivation, bring­
ing about a rise of five or six degrees, possibly even twelve, in the
uncultivated regions such as Siberia and the north of Canada. There
are two reasons for the climate to become milder in the areas adjoin­
ing the sixtieth parallel: the effect of increased cultivation and the
influence of the crown, which will mean that only temperate winds,
like the ones which blow from Barbary across to Genoa and
Marseilles, will emanate from the pole. The conjunction of the two
factors will cause the sixtieth parallel to bask in the temperatures
currently enjoyed by the fully cultivated regions of the forty-fifth,
such as Bordeaux, Lyons, Turin and Venice, so that the cities of
Stockholm, St Petersburg, Tobolsk and Y akutzk, in the coldest lati­
tude on earth, will enjoy temperatures comparable to those in Gas­
cony or Lombardy, always allowing for the slight variations caused
by the proximity of mountains and the sea. And the coastal regions
of Siberia, unviable today, will enjoy the gentle temperature of Pro­
vence and Naples.
Another very important improvement brought by the northern
crown will be the prevention of all atmospheric extremes, whether
of hot or cold, humidity or aridity, storm or calm. The influence
of the crown, in concert with that of universal cultivation, will
introduce an even temperature to the globe of a kind which is
not possible anywhere at present. The most icy climates in the
world, such as those on a line from St Petersburg to Okhotsk,
will enjoy temperatures such as can as yet only be found in the
most renowned resorts, like Florence, Nice, Montpellier and
Lisbon, blessed as they are with gentle and unruffied skies.

First part: The general destinies
According to my calculations those areas have a maximum of
four months of good, temperate weather, yet after the creation
of the northern crown the sixtieth parallel, i.e. the line from St
Petersburg to Okhotsk, will have at least eight, and will be
assured of a double harvest. For a demonstration of this, see the
note below/ in which I explain what causes the long winters and
J

As well as the tilt of the earth's axis, which is the natural cause of winters, there
are three accidental causes which combine to make winter four times as bad as it
should be and which will cease to exist in the combined order. They are:
The uncultivated state of the globe, particularly the land near the pole.
The polar ice cap which, in the absence of the sun, doubles the influence of
frost.
The icy emanations of the pole which counteract the sun's influence as it returns
after the winter solstice.
With the creation of the crown, these three influences will be neutralised. I have
already said that the latitude of St Petersburg will be more easily able to produce
two harvests a year than Tuscany and other regions on that latitude are at present,
and that the sixtieth parallel will have a more unchanging season of fine weather
than is yet possible anywhere on earth: this I shall now explain.
Once the north polar regions have been lit and warmed by the crown, and
agricultural production has started, there will be nothing to counteract the influ­
ence of the sun as spring approaches, the period when at the moment glacial winds
spread from the pole over the whole hemisphere, creating a second winter; which
is why winter in France carries on until May and takes up the best part of the
spring, when the days are of moderate length.
After the creation of the crown, the north wind, the wind from the pole, will
be temperate even in winter and will warm up the sixtieth parallel as it blows over
it. There will be no other source of cold winds except the area around the sixtieth
parallel, and that will receive warmth from two directions, from both north and
south. So spring will begin in March in St Petersburg, and even earlier in the
seventieth parallel; in Paris and Spitzbergen it will be well under way by the
middle of February.
This would happen naturally if it were not artificially hindered by polar winds
and other emanations which halt the germination which should attend the return
of the sun and give us a second, factitious winter after the true one. Never has
this calamity been more striking than in 1 807. Last year in Paris the bad weather
appeared to be over by 15 February; the sun shone warmly and everybody thought
it was the beginning of spring. Then winds from the north and north-west initiated
another winter which continued for two and a half months so that it was still cold
at the beginning of May. This dreadful setback happens almost every year and
makes the French climate unbearable. There is no period of really fine weather,
as the temperatures in summer are always too high, and, apart from the shift from
autumn to winter, the transitions between the seasons are too sudden. There arc
only three months of bearable weather in France, in May, September and October.
It is subtle variation in temperature that makes a fine season: a light frost and
cloudless weather in January seems as pleasant as a day in spring, so long as the
frost docs not last too long, comes gradually and in suitable weather and is not
accompanied by icy winds, low cloud and freezing fog. That is what winters will
49

The Theory of the Four Movements

be like in the new order. Vines will grow on the sixtieth parallel and orange trees
on the fifty-third and the seventieth. Warsaw will have groves of orange trees as
Lisbon does now, and vines will be more securely established in St Petersburg
than they are today in Mainz, because the transformation of the polar winds into
zephyrs will protect them from those sudden and unexpected changes which are
still one of the main causes of impoverishment everywhere.
The pole's icy influence renders our natural winters, in January, much too harsh
and makes them start over again at the end of the month when they should be
coming to an end. These two factors are enough to make our hemisphere a detest­
able place to Jive as far south as the fortieth parallel in Europe and the thirtieth
in Asia and America, where the cold is even more severe: Philadelphia and Peking,
which are on the same latitude as Lisbon and Naples, have even more unpleasant,
bitter winters than Frankfurt and Dresden, which are eleven or twelve degrees
further north.
It may be thought that if the blasts of winter can be so far reduced in the
northern temperate zone temperatures near the equator will become intolerably
hot, but this will not be the case; other factors will contribute to making the
equator more temperate, making summer in Senegal less enervating than summer
now is in France. A benign and moderate range of temperatures will take the place
of the storms and hurricanes which extend from the equator to the temperate
zones and new climates will appear at the middle of the globe as at its poles. I
shall not say anything here about the causes of this correction of the equatorial
temperature, as they do not have anything to do with the creation of the northern
crown. To sum up, when these various principles of moderation are operating on
the earth's atmosphere, the worst climate - such as that at Okhotsk and Yakutzk will be able to rely on eight or nine months' fine weather and a sky free of fogs
and hurricanes, which will become almost unheard of on the continental land
masses, and occur only very rarely in areas near the sea.
It goes without saying that these improvements will not affect high mountains
and areas close to the sea to the same extent, particularly the three continental
extremities near the south pole, which will not have a crown and will always be
shrouded in ice and fog. This however will not prevent areas close to that pole
sharing in different ways in the crown's influence, which among other benefits
will change the taste of the sea and disperse or precipitate bituminous particles
by spreading a boreal citric acid. In combination with salt, this liquid will give the
sea a flavour of the kind of lemonade known as aigresel. It will thus be easy to
remove the saline and citric particles from the water and render it drinkable, which
will make it unnecessary for ships to be provisioned with barrels of water. This
breaking down of sea water by the boreal liquid is a necessary preliminary to the
development of new sea creatures, which will provide a host of amphibious servants
to pull ships and help in fisheries, replacing the ghastly legions of sea-monsters
which will be annihilated by the admixture of boreal fluid and the consequent
changes in the the sea's structure. The sudden death of all of them will rid the
Ocean of these vile creatures, images of the intensity of our passions which are
represented by the bloodthirsty battles of so many monsters. Death will strike
them all at the same moment, just as we shall see the hateful customs of civilised
man, barbarians and savages disappear in an instant, to give way to the virtues
which will be honoured triumphantly in the combined order because they will
become the way to wealth and pleasure.
N.B. The Caspian Sea and other inland salt-water lakes, like the Aral Sea, Lake
Zare, Lake Jeltondc, the Gulf of Mexico and even the Black Sea which is almost
50

First part: The general destinies
other climatic disorders the world is subject to during the first
phase of the Social Movement.
In anticipation of the proof of this future event, we may observe
various signs which indicate its approach: first, the contrast in form
between the lands in the region of the south pole and those in the
region of the north; the three southern continents taper to a point
in such a way as to distance relations with the polar latitudes. A
quite different form is to be observed in the northern continents,
which broaden out as they approach the pole and are grouped
around it to receive the rays from the ring which will one day crown
it; their main rivers flow in that direction as if to attract relations
with the Arctic Ocean. Now if God had not planned to give this
life-giving crown to the north pole, it would follow that the dispo­
sition of the continents around the pole would be a sign of inepti­
tude; and God would look all the more ridiculous for having acted
so wisely in his arrangement of the southern continents, which he
has given dimensions perfectly suited to a pole which will never
have a life-giving crown.
cut off from other seas, will receive only a small and very gradual share of the
boreal fluid's influence. They will receive none of the underwater currents which
will spread out from the pole into all the Oceans and partly open seas. These lakes
will only absorb the subtlest flavourings, dispersed into the atmosphere from the
crown itself, so the fish in these bituminous reservoirs will not be destroyed by
boreal fluid from the crown. There will be so little of it, and it will be introduced
so slowly and so imperceptibly, that they will become accustomed to it within two
or three generations and grow stronger than in bituminous water, in the same way
as fruit grows better and develops a fuller flavour if it is grafted on to wild stock.
So as soon as the human race sees the approach of the crown they will set in
motion the same procedure for sea creatures as Noah did for those on the land
when he gathered pairs of each species he wanted to save. They will take enough
of all the fish, shellfish, sea-plants and other products of the sea they want to

conserve, put them in salt-water lakes like the Caspian Sea, and return them to
the Ocean after their regeneration. They will wait until the Ocean has undergone
its desperate remedy and been purged by the waves of boreal fluid which will spread
out from the pole with tremendous force, precipitating bitumen at such a rate that
all the fish will be taken by surprise at the sudden change and will suffocate. All
that will be left will be the useful species like whiting, herring, mackerel, sole,
tuna and any others which do not attack divers and which will have been kept
separate, to be replaced after the purification of the sea, and protected from the
violent shock of the boreal liquid which they will gradually and slowly become
accustomed to the inland seas. These species being entirely harmless will coexist
happily with the newly created fish, seven-eighths of which will be servants of
man, as will the terrestrial animals to be created in the future (as shown in the
table following p. 42).
51

The Theory of the Four Movements
It might be lamented that God placed Cape Horn so far south as
to constitute a temporary obstacle. His intention, though, is that this
route should be abandoned and that navigable ship canals should be
cut through the isthmusses of Suez and Panama, tasks which, like
so many others, terrify civilised man but will be child's play for the
industrial armies of the spheric hierarchy.
Another prognosis of the crown is the defective position of the
global axis. If we were to assume that the crown was never to appear
the axis ought, for the good of the two continents, to be turned
back by one twenty-fourth, or seven and a half degrees, along the
meridian that passes through the Sandwich Islands and Constantin­
ople, so that the latter would be situated at thirty-two degrees north;
the consequence of this would be that on longitude 225, that passes
through the island of Hierro in the Canaries, the Northern Strait
and the two extremities of Asia and America would extend pro­
portionately further into the polar ice-cap. This would sacrifice the
least useful part of the globe to the benefit of everywhere else, as
we can see by looking in more detail at the polar and temperate
reg10ns.
As far as the polar regions are concerned, we can see that the
northern straits are completely useless because of the way Cape
Szalaginskoi protrudes, so moving the strait further into the ice-cap
would hardly matter as it is already unnavigable. Yet moving it
closer to the pole would push the most valuable region of the glacial
area, the Gulf of Archangel and the White Sea, further away and
render them much more viable, as North Cape in Lapland would
then only be sixty-four degrees north, the same level as Jakobstad,
the northernmost city in Finland. Maritime relations could easily
be extended to the mouths of the Ob' and the Yenisey, as the shift
in the earth's axis would make them six degrees warmer, and the
consequent cultivation of eastern Siberia would raise the tempera­
ture a further six degrees. It would thus be possible to establish
maritime communication between one end of the great continent
and the other, and Chinese products could be transported from the
elbow of the Huang He to Lake Baikal and thence could be
embarked and sent cheaply to Europe down the Angara and the
Yenisey.
In our temperate zone, important waterways such as the English
Channel and the Sund would similarly benefit by being five or six

First part: The general destinies
degrees closer to the equator. The gulfs of St Lawrence and Korea
would hardly move at all, but the whole of the Baltic would gain
a good seven degrees and St Petersburg would move to a position
level with Berlin .
I shall not say anything about the equatorial regions because a
move of seven and a half degrees would not be of any consequence
in those latitudes.
Towards forty-five degrees south, the southern tip of America
would be a little closer to the equator, which would be advan­
tageous. The extremities of Australia would also benefit, to a greater
degree, and the tip of Africa would drop from thirty-five to forty­
two degrees south but would be no less navigable, and in any case
will sooner or later be abandoned in favour of the Suez Canal.
If you trace out the latitudes on a planisphere, readjusted in
accordance with this shift of axis, you will see that it will benefit
the whole earth, except for a few cantons which are not worth con­
sidering, like Kamchatka. God would have set the axis the way I
have outlined if we were not to be given the northern crown, which
will enable our ridiculously positioned axis to be relocated where it
will be most conducive to the general good, an unanswerable argu­
ment for the necessity of the crown and its future creation.
Nobody has previously pointed out the unsatisfactory nature of
the axis because the philosophic spirit draws us away from rational
criticism of of God's works into more extreme positions, doubting
providence or falling into mindless, blind admiration, like that dem­
onstrated by certain scholars who admire spiders, toads and other
such filth, which can only seem a cause for shame on the creator's
part until such time as we understand the motives behind their
misshapen existence. The same is true of the axis of the globe: its
defective positioning is designed to lead us to criticise God and
thereby divine the creation of the crown which will justify the cre­
ator's apparent mistake. But our philosophical extremism, the mania
for atheism or total admiration, has led us away from any kind of
impartial judgement of the works of God, and we have therefore
been unable to decide on the necessary correctives to his work, or
to have any inkling of the material and political revolutions through
which he will carry out these improvements.
I have gone into all this detail in order to prove that the material
disposition of the continents and landmasses was not random . I
53

The Theory of the Four Movements
shall provide a second proof after this note (when I deal with com­
mercial monopoly in Archipelagos). Chance· will soon lose the
exalted power philosophy ascribes to it instead of to providence,
and people will recognise that God has kept it within very strict
limits, as for example in this case of the continents where, far from
it being an effect of chance, God has calculated what would be most
suitable, even down to preparing a special position for a capital of
universal unity. Even today everybody is struck by the uniquely
marvellous way he has made Constantinople a centre of usefulness
and pleasure. Everybody sees the hand of God in it, and says 'This
is where the capital of the world should be. ' It will have to be sited
there, and the first meridian of universal harmony will be fixed at
its antipodes.
On the subject of the northern crown, I should add that there is
nothing extraordinary in the prediction of this meteor if you think
of the rings of Saturn: why should God not give us what he gives
to other worlds? Is the existence of a polar ring harder to compre­
hend than that of the equatorial belts around Saturn?
The sight of those two rings of light ought, of course, to have
banished our preconceived ideas about the sun, so absurdly
imagined as a world in flames. Herschel is the only person to have
offered a proper description of it as 'a vast and magnificent world
bathed in an ocean of light. ' It was obvious from the moment Sat­
urn's two rings were sighted that if God could surround a globe
with circular rings, he could do it with spherical ones, or provide
polar rings or polar caps: all that remains to be understood are the
theories governing their distribution, which will allow our globe to
share a favour which until now only Saturn has enjoyed. Other
planets, too, will receive it, from the vortices from which they all
draw some kind of decorative light to warm one or both poles; ours
is more or less without it because it is one of the most impoverished
planets in the firmament. I shall show that our twenty-eight planets,
and another twenty or so which have not been discovered yet, are
just the traces of a vortex, a badly organised small cohort, like the
fleeing remnants of a regiment destroyed in battle. Other vortices
have four to five hundred planets arranged in Series of groups, that
is they contain satellites of satellites, all equipped with rings,
crowns, polar caps and other ornaments. If such favour is in store
for our globe it is a just recompense for the misfortunes which
54

First part: The general destinies
condemned it, in its first phase, to be the most wretched of all the
planets in the vortex.
There may be some accidental disturbances to the succession
assigned to the thirty-two social periods, as for example the entry
of a new planet into the vortex which seems likely to happen
because of the extreme distance between the sun and the largest
planets. These stars, few in number and with widely separate orbits,
form a rather tenuous line which any comet is liable to break
through; there are various ways in which this might happen, one
of which I outline in the note below.' The contiguity and intercon' I assume that if a large comet, the size of Jupiter, reaches its moment of fecundation, and is at the right level for becoming a planet, it would try to enter the line
and take up a position in a vortex. If it arrived above our Sun parallel to the level
of the planetary orbits it could, as it returned, take up a position between the Sun
and Jupiter; instead of continuing on its parabolic course, it would describe a spiral
as it investigated the area and looked for a point of equilibrium between Jupiter
and the Sun. In the course of this spiral it would come close to all the small,
isolated planets, which would be drawn to it as Moons. The Earth and Venus,
which are the largest, are still much too weak to put up any resistance to a large
attractive world approaching them, and the comet would be attractive as soon as
it fixed itself on our Sun.
From then on our little globe would be drawn in, becoming one of the Moons
of the intruder, which would soon become the richest and most fertile planet in
the whole vortex because of its proximity to the Sun and the large number of its
Moons. The intruder would form an association with Venus, Mars, Earth and all
the smaller globes between the Sun and Jupiter, creating a brilliant retinue of seven
or eight satellites and, like Saturn, would produce a double equatorial ring or a
double corona at both poles as these twofold embellishments are allocated to all
septilunary planets when their inhabitants have formed the combined order.
(Saturn has not always had its two rings and it will lose them again at the end of
its course, when its social mechanism descends once more to the order of incoher­
ent Series. )
The highly probable advent o f such a comet would b e a n extremely advantageous
revolution for our globe, because it would immediately produce a very fruitful new
creation, ensuring the emergence of progressive Series and the downfall of civilised
and barbarous states.
The transformation of our globe into a lunar world would bring no harm to the
human race; the alteration in the order of days and seasons might destroy some
animal and vegetable species, but not the most useful ones like horses, sheep and
so on which would remain to augment the riches which the new creation would
immediately give us.
The new planet would become a vice-Sun, which would shed an immense light
over us; we would also have the adventitious light of its satellites; these, revolving
in neighbouring orbits, could provide us with as many as six Moons at once when
they appeared together in the semi-circle of our orbit. We may conclude from this
that the great comets which so frighten the human race are really a source of hope,
not terror, as their establishment in the vortex would become a guarantee of our
happiness.
55

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
nections of Ceres, Pallas and Juno are evidence that the orbits could
be much closer to each other without resulting in agglomeration
and, in anticipation of this, I estimate that there would need to be
a distance of thirty million leagues between Jupiter and Saturn, and
the same between Saturn and Uranus . The vast distances of 1 3 0
and 260 million leagues which currently exist between them are a
factor of the paucity of planets: because there are so few of them,
they are forced to occupy not just the same space as a complete
vortex with four or five hundred planets, but an even larger one.

God created sixteen species of man, namely nine on the old conti­

differ is not important. See the note below/

f

This revolution would be one of the smallest foreseeable. It might happen that
instead of one cornet a mass of three or four hundred might suddenly turn up and
establish themselves near our Sun, to their benefit and ours. Such an event is the
more likely as our vortex is, as I have said, astronomic debris waiting for replace­
ments. The average total for a vortex is four hundred planets orbiting the Sun;
ours, which has only thirty or so, is surely more like a legion reduced to a shadow
of itself, a weakened platoon that will serve as the nucleus and rallying-point for
the mass of new recruits who are sent to it.
One of the most interesting of the celestial revolutions which could affect our
planetary system would be the dispersal of the Milky Way and the despatch of
one of its formations to our vortex. If that happened we would have the pleasure
of seeing dazzling legions composed of hypermoons or stars of moderate brightness,
like the Moon, pass by us for thousands of years. As they passed they would heat
both poles on all our planets so that they could be cultivated, which would bring
about a further and most magnificent creation, whose value for us would be
incalculable.
Among the sixteen primitive races, we must distinguish the four heterogeneous
races: I Northern Dwarves, like the Lapps and Samoyeds; 2. Southern Giants, like
Patagonians, etc.; 3. Native Albinos, like the Bedas of Ceylon and the American
Darians; 4. Native Negroes, with squashed faces, from Guinea.
Albinos and Negroes both existed from creation, although the human race has
the capacity to produce them itself. The Albinos were the only one of the four
heterogeneous races to be found on both continents.
These four races are very different from the rest; the other twelve are more or
less variations on a common type, and can thus be called homogeneous races. A
proper definition of their original differences is a calculus of organic movement
that I shall not go into here; I merely want to criticise the timidity which has so

First part: The general destinies
The three species with straight, convex and concave features were
placed in the northern temperate zone, between thirty and thirty­
five degrees north. (I am speaking only about the old continent.)
These were the latitudes in which they were able to organise primi­
tive society, the confused Series. This social order could last no
longer than about three centuries; the reader already knows that I
shall only provide information about it in terms of the eighth
period, which sees the organisation of a much more interesting set
of Series than the primitive ones we are dealing with here.
These first men emerged happy from the hands of God because
they were able to organise a society with Series, and all societies
of that sort are more or less happy as they allow the passions to
develop.
Most wild beasts and reptiles were created near the equator, with
a few, such as wolves, created in the cold latitudes, and before they
spread to the area between thirty and thirty-five degrees north they
did not bother the races of men that were put there, i.e. the races
with straight, concave and convex features. These races found an
far characterised discussion of this subject. We still see scholars arguing about how
the inhabitants of America arrived there. God, it seems, did not have the power
to create in America as he did in Europe. And because they find incongruities like
the bearded Eskimos among other natives who are unbearded they conclude that
the Eskimos must have come from the nearby old continent. But this is wrong:
Eskimos, like many others, are of primitive origin: differences between peoples are
never the result of chance.
The twelve homogeneous races were divided into two groups, seven on the old
continent and five in America. And although beardless and bearded men are to be
found side by side, there is nothing surprising about that. The sixteen races must
supply the differences called for by the theory of movement and still clearly to be
seen all over the earth . Despite invasions, despite the capture of women and slaves
and the consequent mixing of races, the forms of features have remained the same,
nothing has been able to destroy the original types; even fashion has practically

no power to change them: our physiognomies are still similar to those of the ancient

nations whose portraits have survived from three thousand years ago. Racial differ­
ences therefore must not be attributed to revolutions or chance: we can see in
them, as in all the other varieties of creation, the effects of a distributive theory
which we do not as yet understand. The key to it is to be found in the laws of
organic movement.
I apologise to the fabulists who derive the whole human race from a single
source, but it is surely ignoring the obvious to imagine that the convex features
of Senegal and the concave faces of China, that the Kalmuks, the Europeans, the
Patagonians and the Lapps, are all offshoots of a single tree. In all the branches
of his creation, God establishes an ascending and descending series of discrete
nuances: why then when he created the human race should he have departed from
the order he follows in all the other objects of creation, from stars down to insects?

abundance of the best animals and plants of creation, and indeed
had some which are no longer known to us, like the mammoth
whose bones have been discovered, which had no way of defending
itself and must have perished with primitive society, which it served
in so many important ways.
Originally these three races had no social organisation. It was not
just instinct that led them to form Series: they were encouraged to
do so by five sets of circumstances which no longer exist.

The absence ofpreconceived ideas, and consequently an amorous
freedom which is inadmissible in incoherent societies, where
people are organised in families or isolated households.
The numerical paucity of inhabitants. This resulted in a super­
abundance of flocks, fruit, fish, game, etc. God placed the
groups of these first men at great distances from each other
and it took a long time for them to become sufficiently numer­
ous to define their own territory.
The absence of any indicative signs of wealth. They lacked any
mechanical skill and had no precious objects of fixed value, such
as the weapons and ornaments of savages. They had instead an
abundance of perishable provisions and riches, and the diffi­
culty of accumulating these gave rise to the idea of anticipatory
compensation, which favoured the formation of Series.
The absence of wild beasts. Their distance from each other
helped make them very mild in manner, preventing murder­
ous inventions and the spirit of bellicosity, and helped to pre­
serve animals now lost, like the mammoth.
The beauty of beings in their original state. It is a great mistake
to think that when they were created animals and plants were
as they are now, in the wild. The aurochs, for example, or
the wild sheep are are not ancestors of cattle and sheep but
degenerate forms of them. The flocks and herds created by
God were superior to the finest Swiss cattle and the best
Spanish sheep; the same is true of flowers and fruits. 'Every­
thing was good when it left the hands of the creator', says
Rousseau: it is a truth for which he adduces no evidence, and
he weakens it in the next line by adding: 'In man's hands
everything degenerated .'1 But it was not man who brought
animals and plants down to the level they are at now, whether

First part: The general destinies
domesticated or wild; it was incoherence, by breaking down
the order of Series, that made the world's produce deteriorate,
even man himself, whose original height was seventy-four and
two-thirds inches, or six feet two and two-thirds inches, for
the straight-featured race. In those days the race easily lived
to the age of a hundred and twenty-eight (eight times sixteen);
the rest of the earth's progeny was equally vigorous, while the
roses of creation were more beautiful than the ones in our
gardens. This general perfection continued throughout the
first social period, which was made possible by the concur­
rence of these five circumstances.
Peace reigned not because of the general well-being but because
of a property inherent in the Series, namely the development and
systematic involvement of the passions which, outside progressive
Series, clash with each other and give rise to war and every other
sort of discord. However it is important to realise that there was
no equality or community in the primitive order. Philosophic chim­
eras of that sort, as I have said, are incompatible with progressive
Series, which demand the opposite, a scale of inequalities. They
may have had a scale of this sort in the original period, even though
they could not write, for describing and defining the interests of
each society member. I shall explain the method they used to class­
ify satisfactorily such a wide variety of claims.
The passions were more violent then than they are today. Men
had none of that pastoral simplicity that has never existed anywhere
outside poetry. They were proud, sensual, and the slaves of their
desires; women and children were the same; the so-called vices were
pledges of concord, and will be pledges of social harmony once
more, as soon as the Series are reconstituted.

They must have become disorganised as a result of incidents con­
trary to the five productive circumstances I have j ust described.
Too-rapid multiplication of clans soon produced poverty, while the
activities of the wild beasts which were arriving from the equator
encouraged the invention of weapons; pillage grew rapidly in popu­
larity because agriculture was hard, still in its infancy, and unable
to provide the superabundance of food necessary to the mechanism
of Series; this in turn gave rise to marriage, division into incoherent
households, then the transition to the savage, patriarchal and bar­
barous order.
59

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
While primitive Series lasted the condition of the human race
was such a fortunate one that people must have despaired as they
saw the Series disintegrating. Children were the last support of that
order; they covered the political retreat and remained together in
harmony long after the fathers had fallen into dissension and were
on the verge of setting up isolated households and exclusive mar­
riages, the idea of which was suggested by their growing poverty.
The poorer they became, the greater the tribal chiefs' interest in
establishing marriage, which eventually prevailed.
Before they arrived at this extreme they must have tried a variety
of more or less unsuccessful measures to sustain the primitive order,
and when they finally recognised that that lovely social order could
never be re-established the tribal chiefs - seeing that regret for what
had been lost was plunging nations into apathy and distaste for
work - set about weakening all memories of lost happiness, stories
of which could do nothing but disturb the new social order.
As a result all the chiefs agreed to distort the tradition. They
could not deny it altogether as long as there were still eye-witnesses
but it was easy enough to delude the generations that followed, who
had not seen the order of industrial Series. They deliberately spread
contradictory stories to cast doubts on all of them; hence those more
or less absurd myths, believed all over the East, about an Earthly
Paradise from which man was evicted.
One aspect of the hogwash they used to distort the truth that
needs particular emphasis is the use of mysterious secrets and
initiations among the priests of the ancient East. Originally, these
mysteries were almost certainly the traditions of the primitive order,
but as increasing adversity required new precautions to keep the
distressing secret from the nations, it had to be restricted to a tiny
number of initiates, and false mysteries invented to mislead the
enquiring subordinates admitted to the priesthood . To continue to
keep the tradition secret meant limiting it to such a small number
of adepts that all the true initiates may have been wiped out in a
war or similar incident. The mass of the priests would still have
continued its mysterious initiations, which no longer had any sub­
stance, being merely a trick to enable them to maintain the social
position they had achieved.
Presumably the priests of Isis and Bramah had already been
reduced to this level of ignorance and no longer had any idea of
60

First part: The general destinies
primitive order; in any case such ideas would very quickly have
been distorted in those crude days before the invention of writing,
when every narrator added something of his own to the stories he
transmitted. Orientals are just as good at spinning tales as those who
live beside the Garonne, and I estimate that after three centuries the
tradition must have been so altered by additional legends that it
would have been unimaginable, even to true initiates. All that
remained was one fundamental truth: a past happiness, lost and never
to be regained. From this the priests argued for God's alleged anger,
banishment from a favoured dwelling, and other stories designed
to intimidate the multitude and teach them what the sacerdotal body
wanted them to know.
I think I have adequately described the causes for our remaining
in complete ignorance of primitive society. This ignorance will
cease: the theory of Social Movement will bring the subject back
into the light, and describe the mechanism of that first stage of
society in full detail, and show how it was succeeded by savagery,
the patriarchate and barbarism.
The five periods organised in incoherent families:
second , third, fourth, fifth and sixth

I shall deal with these five social periods in a single chapter: it
would take too long to give individual details for each of them, and
take us beyond the scope of this sketch, which is not even a full
summary.
Passing over the second or savagery, which is of no great interest,
we come to the patriarchate, or third stage. This society is almost
unknown: although thought to be a primitive order, it was not to
be found among any peoples in the first two ages. Human beings
of all races were free of prejudice when they were created, and
nowhere dreamed of making amorous freedom a crime: their vigour
and longevity gave them quite contrary opinions, and led them to
orgies, incest and the most lubricious customs. When all peoples
shared a life-span of 1 28 years, and consequently had a good hun­
dred years to devote to love, they could scarcely have been per­
suaded, as the sanctimonious members of Civilisation have been,
that they ought to spend their hundred years of love with one
woman, without loving any others.

The Theory of the Four Movements
A long time was required to create the circumstances that made
restrictions of amorous freedom necessary: the race had to lose a
large part of its primitive vigour before it acceded to rules so con­
trary to the interest of healthy people. But as their strength visibly
declined, the disintegration of the Series opened the way for coerc­
ive control over love and for savage and patriarchal societies, etc.
There is as much ignorance of the patriarchate as about primitive
society. Abraham and Jacob, in the form they are depicted, are not
patriarchal: they were barbarians, shaped by cruelty and injustice,
and kept harems and slaves, in the manner of the barbarians. They
were, unmistakably, pashas or tyrants, indulging in every sort of
dissolute behaviour; what could be more vicious and unjust than
Abraham sending Agar and her son Ishmael into the desert to die
of hunger for no other reason than that he had had enough of the
woman and wanted to be rid of her. That was his motive for sending
a woman and her young child to their deaths. It is a fine example
of the patriarchal virtues: there is nothing but equally odious behav­
iour to be found among all the patriarchs.
Yet philosophy wants to encourage us to revive patriarchal cus­
toms. The philosopher Rayna!, in his history of the two Indies, begins
with a ceremonial eulogy of the Chinese, representing them as the
most perfect of nations because they have retained the patriarchal cus­
toms .2 Let us analyse this perfection in more detail: China, with its
much-vaunted culture, is so poor that you see people eating handfuls
of the lice and bugs their clothes are infested with. China is the only
country where cheating is legal and applauded: every merchant has
the right to sell false measures and work other swindles of the sort that
even barbarians punish. The Chinese, though, pride themselves on
their corruption, and when a tradesman has tricked somebody, he
calls his neighbours round to receive their praise and laughter along
with those of the victim [though the law does not allow him any
redress] . As a nation they are the most litigious there has ever been:
nowhere else do they argue as obstinately and relentlessly as in China.
The depths of their behaviour are so base, and they have so little idea
of honour, that the executioner is one of the close associates, one of
the high officers, of the sovereign, who makes him thrash his court­
esans before his eyes. The Chinese are the only people who publicly
2

Europiens dans /es deux lndes.

First part: The general destinies
despise their Gods and drag their idols in the mud when they do not
provide what they have been asked for. They have taken infanticide
to greater lengths than any other nation; they expose their children
on dungheaps where they are eaten alive by pigs, or else float them
downriver attached to an empty pumpkin shell. They are also
extremely jealous and persecutory of women, whose feet are bound
from infancy so that they are incapable of walking. As for children,
fathers have the right to play dice for them and to sell them as slaves.
Lastly, the Chinese are the greatest cowards on earth and in order not
to frighten them it is customary to point the guns on town walls
upwards, even when they are not loaded. With customs like these, of
which I have only given a very incomplete outline, the Chinese have
nothing but scorn for civilised peoples, because they are less dis­
honest. They say that the Europeans are blind when it comes to busi­
ness, that only the Dutch have an eye for it, but that the Chinese have
two. (The distinction is flattering to the Dutch [and to the spirit of
commerce] . )
These are the men who preach philosophy and whom Raynal
would have us take as models. Of course Raynal knows, better than
anybody, that China is the repository of all the social vices, that it
is the moral and political sewer of the globe, but he has praised
their customs because they fit in well with the attitude of the philos­
ophers, with their sophisms about thrift and the industrial isolation
they want to propagate. That is the real reason why they are so
enthusiastic about patriarchal life, despite its odious results, because
the Chinese and the Jews, the nations most faithful to the patriar­
chal customs, are also the most vicious and deceitful in the world.
In order to side-step these accounts of the reality, the philos­
ophers depict only the most favourable aspect of China, saying
nothing about corruption, nor about the terrible poverty of its
people. As for the Jews, their social vices are often attributed to the
persecution they have suffered, whereas in fact persecution encour­
ages nobility among outlaws. Christians were never more honour­
able than when they were an object of persecution and had no
prince and no rallying-point. Why should religious oppression
produce such different results in the two peoples? Because the christ­
ians, in their misfortune, adopted that corporate frame of mind
which engenders noble passions among outcasts, whereas the Jews
retained the patriarchal outlook which is the origin of the lowest

The Theory of the Four Movements
passions, and which had in fact brought them down in the days of
their power. Has there ever been a more contemptible nation than
the Hebrews, who never made a single advance in the arts and
sciences, and who were distinguished only by their habitual crime
and brutality, accounts of which depress the spirit on every page of
their disgusting annals?
This digression ought to lead on to an analysis of the patriarchal
mind and the vices and dissimulation it nurtured in the heart. But
this short account being unable to allow of such discussions I shall
return to the question , and restrict myself to pointing out how
ignorant the civilised are about the federal patriarchate, which was
the third period of ascending incoherence.
The Federal Patriarchate was made up of free, neighbouring famil­
ies, united in congresses, like the Tartars. In this state of affairs, patri­
archal families started to want to improve the position of official
wives, gradually increasing their privileges and their civil rights until
they reached the state of semi-liberty they enjoy today. This measure
enabled the members of the patriarchate to leave the third period and
enter the fifth, Civilisation. Civilisation cannot be created out of sav­
agery or barbarism; savages and barbarians never spontaneously adopt
our social customs.g Even the Americans, despite all their attempts to
seduce and trick the natives, have not yet brought any of the tribes to
full Civilisation: the natural course of the movement demands that it
is created from federal patriarchates or from an altered barbarism like
that of the ancient Orientals who, in different ways, shared some of
the characteristics of the federal patriarchate.
As for incoherent patriarchates, like that of Abraham and Jacob,
they only lead to barbarism, an order in which every father becomes
a satrap, erects his slightest whim into a virtue, and wields the
most appalling tyranny over his family, following the examples of
Abraham and Jacob who were as unjust and corrupt as any of the
rulers of Tunis or Algiers.
Savagery, barbarism and Civilisation are not much better known
than the patriarchate: when I have an opportunity to deal with the
phases and characteristics of each period, I shall show that our
philosophical luminaries are as misleading about Civilisation as they
' The only recorded examples are the petty king of the Sandwich Islands and one
or two hordes in Ohio who have begun, very roughly, to make this change. The
exception proves the rule.

First part: The general destinies
are about how to emerge from it and move into the sixth period.
The sixth period, guaranteeism, is one that might have been
invented by the philosophers as it is not very different from civilised
behaviour and retains household life, marriage, swindling and other
central qualities of the philosophical system; it does however sub­
stantially reduce the incidence of revolutions and indigence. On the
other hand, though, however easy it might be for them to invent
the sixth period, how could the philosophers raise the human race
above Civilisation when they do not even know how to raise it as
far as Civilisation, namely to bring savages and barbarians into the
civilised order? They have not even been able to help Civilisation
progress; and when I break down the civilised mechanism into four
phases, I shall show that it reached the third by chance without the
philosophers ever having any influence over their cherished Civilis­
ation. Instead of speeding its progress they have held it back, like
inept mothers whose playfulness tires the child and creates danger­
ous fantasies, seeds of illness, which make it pine away when they
think they are helping it. This is what the philosophers have done
in their enthusiasm for Civilisation: while they thought they were
perfecting it they have in fact been making it worse; they have
nourished the prevailing illusions and propagated error instead of
seeking out the ways of truth. Even today they are still recklessly
endorsing the mercantile spirit which they ought to be combating,
out of shame if nothing else since they have poured scorn on com­
merce for 2,000 years. If therefore it had been left to the philos­
ophers, Civilisation would still be in its first phase and would still
have barbarous customs like slavery, which the scholars of Greece
and Rome were so proud o f.h
I will add one proof of the general ignorance of the civilised
mechanism, taken from the unpredictable calamities which befall
every generation. The most recent was the Jacobin dubs and their
associates: nobody in 1 789 imagined what they would be like, for
all the scholarly analyses of Civilisation. Other calamities will follow
which the philosophers will be equally incapable of foreseeing, such
as commercial feudalism, which will be no less odious than rule of
' The abolition of slavery was the product of the decline of feudalism. That regime
was introduced by chance, not by philosophical calculation which has always p::r­
sisted in preaching prejudices or else reversing them thoughtlessly and without
any preparatory measures, which is even worse than maintaining them.

The Theory of the Four Movements
the clubs and will be the result of the day-to-day influence of the
commercial spirit on the social system. Its encroachment will pro­
duce a terrible innovation, which civilised man is far from pre­
dicting. Nobody, though, should be alarmed by this forecast; it
should cause joy, not fear, because the theory of Social Movement
will provide us with the means of predicting and averting political
stormclouds.
Precise contrasts between societies with pro �ressive
Series and those with incoherent families

The first and seventh societies are formed into Series and in every
respect provide a complete contrast with the second, third, fourth,
fifth and sixth societies, which are organised in /amities. In the latter
five, the good of the whole is in opposition to the passions of the
individual, so that the government, operating for the good of the
whole, is obliged to use force. This never happens in societies of
Series, where the general good coincides so exactly with individual
passions that the administration only has to inform the citizens about
the appropriate measures, such as taxes or special duties. Everything
is paid or carried out by the Series on set days, which require only
one announcement. In the five incoherent societies some measure
of constraint is needed even for the adoption of obviously beneficial
measures which cause no fatigue or distress, like uniform weights
and measures. Whereas if we were in the seventh period, the
government would merely have to inform the people how a job
should be done and send out instructions: as soon as these arrived
in the provinces, in the cantons, they would be adopted without
any further orders being necessary.
Resistance of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth societies
to generally useful measure exists in corporations as well as individ­
uals. In Turkey, for example, the state functionaries, as well as the
ordinary people, rejected the introduction of military discipline,
even though they felt it to be necessary. These second, third, fourth,
fifth and sixth societies, subject to poverty, revolutions, marriage,
swindling, etc., are characterised by repugnance, that is they see and
communicate with each other without ever wanting to imitate each
other. We look at barbaric society without wanting to adopt their

66

First part: The general destinies
customs, they look at ours without wanting to imitate them, and so
on through all five societies organised in incoherent families; like
harmful animals they are mutually incompatible, and if the five were
brought face to face, none would want to be assimilated into any of
the others. There are a few partial exceptions to this rule: the sixth
society, for example, does have a weak attraction for the fifth.
The first and seventh societies, like all other societies of progress­
ive Series, have the general property of attraction; the only exception
to this is society No. 1 , which has a weak attraction for the rich
classes of the fourth, fifth and sixth societies. The seventh society
will be a powerful attraction for all rich and middle classes, even
though it is only a path to the true happiness which we shall begin
to enjoy in the eighth. Yet the seventh is already so fortunate in
comparison to the civilised order that if it could be instantly organ­
ised many weak and sensitive people would fall ill with shock and
sorrow at the sudden sight of so much happiness, which they had
never had and which they would now be able to enjoy.
To give some idea of the attraction which the eighth period,
when it comes, will be able to exert, I shall borrow the words of
another writer, who says: 'If men could ever see the full glory of
God, the excess of wonder might bring about their death.' And
what is this glory of God? Nothing but the reign of the combined
order which will be established and which is the most beautiful of
the divine conceptions. If we could suddenly see the combined
order, the work of God, as it will be in full operation (as I shall
describe it in the dialogues of the year 2200) there is no doubt but
that many civilised people would be struck dead by the force of
their ecstasy. The mere description could arouse an enthusiasm
which would lead to mania in many of them, especially among
women, leaving them indifferent to the pleasures, and unfit for the
tasks, of dreary Civilisation. It is in order to moderate their surprise
that I describe it so far in advance, and that I shall defer description
of the combined order and the comparison of its delights with the
spiritual and bodily miseries endured by civilised man until the
third memorandum. Such a comparison would be bound to excite
the most wretched of them and drive them to despair if it were not
presented in ways designed to minimise its effect, to which end I
shall deliberately inject a note of coolness into the first accounts and

The Theory of the Four Movements
devote them to arid explanations of the general revolutions of the
movement and the follies of civilised man. I shall have more to say
about this.
Societies of incoherent families (the second, third, fourth, fifth
and sixth) having the property of exciting repugnance for agricultural
and manufacturing work and for the arts and sciences, children
reject work and study in these five social orders and become
destructive as soon as they can form groups or free and passionate
associations. This universal inclination of children to destroy when
they are given freedom is a very surprising property of the human
species. In societies of Series, children acquire the opposite qualit­
ies: they work ceaselessly and help in countless ways, quite spon­
taneously taking over all the small tasks which in our society occupy
the abilities of thirty-year-olds. And in progressive Series there is
natural education; the children teach themselves without any exter­
nal prompting or surveillance. As soon as they can walk they are
abandoned to their own devices with no instructions except to enjoy
themselves however they like with groups of friends: all it needs is
competition, the impetus provided by the Series, for these children,
by the age of sixteen, to have acquired ideas about all the areas of
science and the arts and practical knowledge of all the farms and
factories in the canton. All this understanding has cost them
nothing: the reverse, in fact, as they will have some small savings,
the reward for the many tasks they carried out during childhood
through competition, attraction and seeking enjoyment with the
hardest-working Series of children. (See the note' below on the hier­
archy of passionate attraction . )
There can b e n o natural education outside progressive Series.
The education received by each child in incoherent societies varies
according to the whims of teachers or fathers and has nothing in
'

Its development operates by three competing, rival and independent powers: child­
ren, women and men. I place men in the third rank because attraction works from
the weak to the strong; that is, the order of things that will operate industrial
attraction will � raw in children more intensely than their fathers and mothers, and
women more mtenscly than men, so that in the combined order it will be the
children who provide the main impetus to labour and, after them, it will be the
women who draw the men into work.
I shall not go into any more detail about these incomprehensible assertions: they
should provide a hint that the mechanisms of attraction will be the opposite in
every way of civilised opinion. How could it be otherwise, when nothing is more
hostile to nature than Civilisation?
68

First part: The general destinies
common with the purposes of nature, according to which children
should turn their hands to all sorts of work, changing from one to
another almost hourly. In the combined order this is what they will
do, and as a result they will acquire amazing strength and dexterity
because they will be constantly active, always doing different things,
and never doing any one thing for too long. But elsewhere children
become sullen, clumsy, weak and rude, which is why the human
race degenerated in less than fifty years, after the dissolution of the
primitive Series. As soon as the societary order is re-established,
there will be an increase in height among the children brought up
in that order, though not among the grown men: two or three inches
will be added to the human stature each generation until it reaches
an average of 84 inches or 7 feet1 for men, which will take nine
generations. Strength and longevity will increase in a different ratio
over sixteen generations, after which the usual life expectancy will
be 144 years, with other powers proportionately increased as well.
Mental faculties will be developed more rapidly: I estimate that
about twelve years will be enough to change those living automata
we call peasants, who are so coarse as to be closer to the animal
than the human species, into men.
In the combined order even the poorest people, simple agricultural
workers born in an agricultural phalanx, will be initiated into every
kind of knowledge. There will be nothing surprising about this gen­
eral improvement as the combined order will draw people passion­
ately into studying the arts and sciences which will become the path
to vast fortunes, as we shall see in the second part of this account.
Large-scale agricultural and manufacturing industries are not
possible in the first, second or third societies; they only start to

The choice of the twelve-inch Paris foot as a natural measure is not arbitrary: it is
appropriate because it equals one thirty-second of the height of the water in a
suction-pump. The Paris inch and the line [one-twelfth of an inch: Trans.] are
further subdivisions of this natural measure, as natural economy demands that our
numerical medium should contain the greatest number of common divisors in the
smallest unit sum. We therefore have to choose the number 12 and its powers.
Scholars agree on this, although the number IO has come to be preferred in ordi­
nary use, which is quite unsuitable for notation as IO and 14 are the least sub­
dividable of all even numbers. The number IO may be good for civilised man who
is more concerned with habit than reason, and treats the most sensible innovations
as insurmountable obstacles. But when we move to organising a unitary system for
all global communication, like language, measure, numeration, etc., we shall have
to get rid of the numbers 10 and 9 currently in use in Europe and Asia.

The Theory of the Four Movements
appear in the course of the fourth, barbarism. If large-scale industry
could have developed in the first society the human race would have
been spared the misery of passing through the five unhappy periods,
the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth, and would have risen
immediately from the first to the seventh, namely from simple con­
fused Series to simple incoherent Series. This is an advantage
enjoyed by the inhabitants of suns and ringed planets like Saturn:
they do not suffer the disgrace of becoming savages, barbarians and
civilised man, but retain organisation in Series throughout the
course of their societies, a state of well-being they owe to the wealth
of produce provided at their original creation.
On our planet this original creation, which exercises a major
influence on the fate of every globe, was so impoverished that it
was unable to provide the progressive Series with the food neces­
sary for their work for more than a short time. These Series
needed to work at many and varied occupations, and were thus
unable to form near the equator where God had created several
races which were hampered from the outset by the large numbers
of wild beasts, reptiles and insects which paralysed the practice
of industry. It was also impossible to form progressive Series in
the two Americas as they lacked the principal materials of labour,
having no horses, cattle, sheep, pigs or fowls; the same poverty
extended to the vegetable and mineral realms, as the Americans
had no iron or copper.
At a later period, Series were unable to form on the island of
Tahiti, even though the seeds of the societary order were there as
they allowed a degree of amorous freedom. If this island had had
the important animals, plants and ·minerals of the old continent, its
discoverers would have found fully formed confused Series; its
people would have had an average height of 74i inches, the primitive
height of the human race, and the height it would regain after a
few generations in countries where the first or seventh period was
reorganised. I have already said that men will reach 84 inches in
the eighth period, which is yet more favourable to the material and
mental development of the human species and the domestic animals
in its service.
It is in the fourth society, barbarism, that man begins to create
large-scale industry. In the fifth, Civilisation, the sciences and arts
are created and thereafter we have all the resources necessary
to reorganise the primitive Series and raise them to a level of
70

First part: The general destinies
considerable comfort. The sixth period is j ust a path towards indus­
trial Series which are partly formed in the seventh.
The second society, savagery, and the fourth, barbarism, are
periods of stagnation and have no tendency to advance towards a
higher order; savages have no desire to raise themselves to the order
of barbarism, which is higher than theirs in terms of industry. Bar­
barians obstinately refuse to raise themselves to the civilised order.
Both societies, the savage and the barbarous, remain invariably
attached to their customs, good or bad.
The third, fifth and sixth societies tend more or less towards
progress, as witness Civilisation, which does everything it can to
institute improvements: every day, rulers attempt adminstrative
innovations and philosophers put forward new political and ethical
systems; thus Civilisation tries desperately, in theory and in prac­
tice, to reach the sixth society, without being able to attain it,
because, as I have said, this change is a matter of domestic and
industrial procedures, not administrative ones. And philosophy is
exclusively concerned with the latter, never having wished to specu­
late at all about innovation of a domestic or societary order.
I may add a further contrast taken from the way truth is used:
truth rules in societies formed into progressive Series and falsehood
rules in societies formed into incoherent families.
In the former, telling the truth brings greater benefits to every­
body than telling lies. All individuals, whether vicious or virtuous,
love and practise truth as the way to fortune. Thus it happens that
all industrial relations in these twenty-two societies are governed by
dazzling truthfulness.
The opposite is the case with the ten societies of incoherent
families, in which fortunes can only be achieved through trickery
and dishonesty, which is why fraud and swindling triumph
throughout these ten periods, and why Civilisation, one of the
societies of families, can show almost no success that is not based
on trickery, apart from a few very rare exceptions which only serve
to confirm the rule.
The second and sixth societies, savagery and guaranteeism, are
less favourable to lies than Civilisation is, but they are dens of deceit
compared with the blazing truth that reigns in the eighteen societies
of progressive Series.
The conclusion that arises from this may seem ridiculous, but it
can be demonstrated rigorously: the most essential quality required
71

The Theory of the Four Movements
for the triumph of truth in the eighteen societies is love of riches.
The man who, in Civilisation, indulges in every conceivable kind
of deceit will be the most truthful of men in the combined order,
because men like that are not deceitful for the pleasure of it, only
in order to make money. Show him, in a business matter, a profit
of one thousand ecus on a lie and three thousand ecus for telling
the truth and he will prefer the truth, however dishonest he may
be at heart. In this way the most cunning men will rapidly become
the most enthusiastic friends of truth in an order where it leads to
rapid profits and where the practice of lying leads only to certain
rum.
Nothing is easier, therefore, than to bring about the triumph of
truth over the whole of the earth by merely leaving the second,
third, fourth, fifth and sixth societies, and moving into societies
organised in progressive Series. It is a change which should not
cause the slightest trouble as it only affects domestic and industrial
organisation which have nothing to do with government or
administration.
All the arrangements of the combined order will produce com­
plete contrasts to our own customs, and will make it necessary to
protect everything we call vice, such as greed and sexual intrigue;
the cantons where these so-called vices will be most in evidence will
be those which develop industry to the most complete state and
whose shares are most sought after for capital investment.
Strange as these assertions may seem, I set them down in order to
focus attention upon one great truth, namely that God was bound to
form our characters to suit the combined order, which will last 70,000
years, and not to suit the incoherent order, which was to last no more
than 1 0,000. In terms of the requirements of the combined order,
therefore, you will see there is nothing vicious in your passions. As an
example let us look at, say, the character of a housewife.
In the civilised order it might be thought desirable that all women
should enjoy housework as they are all destined to be married and
run an incoherent household. However, if you were to examine
young women's inclinations you would realise that scarcely a quar­
ter of them are good housewives and that the other three-quarters
have no taste for this sort of work, but a great deal of liking for
laziness, flirtation and dissipation. You would conclude from this
that three-quarters of young women are vicious, whereas it is your

First part: The general destinies
social mechanism that is vicious. Indeed, if all young women were
as enthusiastic about housework as you would like them to be,
three-quarters of the female sex would be unsuited to the combined
order which will last 70,000 years, because in that order association
will make household tasks so much simpler that they will not even
require the quarter of women who are occupied with them today;
if a quarter, or even a sixth, of women enjoy housework that will
be more than enough. God was bound to act in accordance with
proportion and create a number of housewives appropriate to the
70,000 years of happiness, rather than to the 5 ,000 years of misery
in which we find ourselves. How could women live harmoniously in
the combined order if four hundred of them turned up to perform a
task that only needed one hundred? It would mean abandoning the
other functions that devolve on them, and all of them would see it
as a lack of judgement in God to have given all women the character
of housewives when he should have restricted it to a quarter of
them.
We must conclude that women are fine as they are, that three­
quarters of them are right to reject housework and that the only
vices lie in Civilisation and philosophy which are incompatible with
the nature of the passions and the views of God, as I shall explain
at greater length in the chapter on attraction.
The same argument holds good for all the passions you call vices.
You will know from the theory of the combined order that all the
elements of our character are good and are wisely distributed, and
that what is natural must be developed, not corrected . You see
children as compounded entirely of vice because they are greedy,
quarrelsome, unpredictable, disobedient, insolent, inquisitive and
unmanageable, yet they are the most perfect of us all. A child like
that will be the keenest worker in the combined order. At the age
of ten he will be promoted to the most eminent children's Series in
the canton, and the honour of presiding at parades and at work will
make even the worst and most tiring tasks seem like play.
For the present, I admit, these children are pretty intolerable, in
fact all children are. But I will not admit that there is anything
vicious about them; their so-called vices are the work of nature, and
the tendency towards greed and licence you find in all children was
given to them by God, who was well able to calculate his plan for
the distribution of characteristics. I repeat, the only things vicious
73

The Theory of the Four Movements
are Civilisation, which does not allow these God-given character­
istics to be developed or put to use, and philosophy which is unwill­
ing to admit that the civilised order is opposed to the views of
nature as it has to stifle children's most universal inclinations, such
as a fondness for greed and disobedience in boys, for laziness and
ostentation in girls, as well as those of people of other ages whose
inclinations or attractions are all ones which God deemed necessary
to fit in with the combined order, which is a synthesis or a develop­
ment of attraction. It is time now to say something about the struc­
ture of attraction, which is something that nobody has ever thought
of doing.
On the study of nature by Passionate Attraction

Our desires are so boundless in relation to the limited means we
have of satisfying them that God seems to have acted rather
thoughtlessly when he gave us passions so eager for pleasure. These
passions seem to have been deliberately created to harass us by
arousing thousands of desires, not even a tenth of which can be
satisfied as long as the civilised order lasts.
Pondering thoughts like these has led moralists to argue that they
are rectifying God's work, tempering or repressing the passions they
cannot satisfy and sometimes do not even recognise: of the twelve
passions which constitute the chief motivating forces of the soul
they are only aware of nine, and they have a very inadequate idea
of the four most important ones.
The nine known passions are the jive sensual appetites which hold
sway to a greater or lesser degree over everybody, and the four simple
appetites of the soul, namely:
6th:
7th :
8th :
9th:

The group
The group
The group
The group

offriendship.
of love.
ofpaternity or family.
of ambition or corporation.

The moralists want to give these passions a dynamic contrary to
that intended by nature, and have been constantly holding forth
over the last 2,000 years about the need to temper and change the
five sensual appetites, trying to persuade us that diamonds are
worthless stones, that gold is a base metal, that sugar and spice are
74

First part: The general destinies
cheap, contemptible products and that labourers' cottages and the
harsh simplicity of nature are preferable to kings' palaces. Thus
moralists have attempted to nullify the sensual passions; and they
have been equally hostile to the passions of the soul . The number
of times they have vociferated against ambition! To hear them you
would think it was wrong to want anything but dull, poorly paid
employment, and that, to be morally correct, if a job paid an income
of 1 00,000 livres you should only accept 1 0,000. Their opinions
about love are even more ridiculous: they want it to be governed
by constancy and fidelity, which are so incompatible with nature's
intentions and so wearisome to both sexes that no creature on earth
submits to them if he is totally free.
None of these philosophical whims, known as duties, bear any
relation to nature. Duty is man-made, attraction comes from God;
so if we want to understand God's intentions we have to study
attraction, in its natural state, with no reference to duty. Duty varies
from one century to another and from place to place, but the nature
of the passions has been and will remain unchangeable for all
peoples.
As an example of such a study, let us look at the relationship
between paternal and filial love.
The moralists want to establish equality of affection between
fathers and children and to that end cite sacred duties which are
utterly at odds with nature. If we want to reveal nature's wishes
we need to forget what should be, i.e. duty, and analyse what is. We
will then recognise that a father's love for his children is about three
times as great as their love for him. This disproportion may seem
enormous and, on the children's part, unjust, but questions of j us­
tice or right behaviour are not relevant when what we are analysing
is what is, not what should be.
If, instead of trying to correct the passions, we try to discover
nature's motives in giving the passions a dynamic so different from
duty's, it soon becomes clear that these vaunted duties have nothing
to do with j ustice, as witness the issue in question, the disproportion
between filial and paternal love. There are, indeed, very plausible
grounds for this inequality: children should not return more than
a third of their parents' love, for the following reasons.
1 st. Until puberty children do not know what paternity and gen­
eration mean. When they are at the age where filial affection takes
75

The Theory of the Four Movements
shape, they cannot understand it or its implications; the nature of
the act that constitutes paternity is carefully hidden from them. At
that stage, therefore, they are only capable of sympathetic love, not
filial love. We should not require their affection as a form of grati­
tude for the care taken over their upbringing because that sort of
considered acknowledgement is beyond their moral capabilities. It
would be very childish to expect such rational love from a being
incapable of reflection. Besides, gratitude there is .friendship not filial
love, which young children can neither feel nor understand.
2nd. Children between the ages of seven and fourteen are con­
stantly harried by the admonishments of their parents, with, among
the lower classes, the additional element of maltreatment. And as
children are not sufficiently rational to appreciate the need for the
restraints imposed on them, their affection must grow in response
to the kindness they receive. A child's grandfather, or a neighbour,
or a servant is often dearer to him than those who gave him life,
something which fathers have no right to complain about. If they
are wise they must realise that children (for the reasons adduced
above) are only capable of sympathetic love, and that such love
develops in response to the kindness and discrimination which
fathers are able to bring to the exercise of their paternal functions.
3rd. When children reach puberty and begin to understand what
mothers and fathers do they also perceive the self-interested motives
behind parental love. They are loved as a reminder of the pleasures
of procreation, for the new hope their birth brings to ambition or
failing powers, and for the delight they provide in childhood when
they enchant their parents' leisure hours. As a result of acquiring
this new understanding children cannot feel greatly indebted to
their parents, having given them so much pleasure they themselves
were excluded from, and which they are deprived of until they
reach adulthood. These ideas tend to cool their affection rather than
increasing it. They realise they were conceived through love of plea­
sure, not love of themselves; that their parents may have conceived
them against their wishes, or added to an already over-large family
by carelessness, or wanted a child of the opposite sex. So at the
period when filial love can begin to develop, in adolescence, the
prestige and importance attached to paternity come under attack
for a whole range of reasons. If parents have not been able to gain
their children's esteem and friendship, they will not see any filial

First part: The general destinies
love develop, even the one-third return at which nature has fixed
the debt to parents. But this return will be perceived to be adequate
when it is recognised that children's upbringing will cause fathers
no problems in the combined order which the globe is moving
towards and to which our passions are predisposed.
If meanwhile the difficulty of bringing up children seems to give
p are nt s an unlimited right to their chil dren' s lo ve, this is because
the three attenuating factors I have j ust pointed out are never taken
into consideration.
1 st. Young children's ignorance about what paternity consists in.
2nd. The aversion they experience as they grow older and encoun­
ter abuse or misdirected paternal authority.
3rd. The contrast they notice in adolescence between the lofty
claims of fathers and the non-existent basis they rest on.
Add to these the minor considerations, like paternal favouritism by
which children are quite rightly offended, and it becomes clear why
the younger generation, as a rule, only feel one-third of the affection
lavished on them by the older. If children do feel more than that,
it is an effect of sympathy, not ties of blood. Thus children some­
times feel two or three times fonder of one parent than the other:
both have equal claims, but one may just have an incompatible
personality.
These are truths that civilised people are unwilling to acknow­
ledge or to use as the basis for their social planning. Their experi­
ence of pleasure is so impoverished that they need a wealth of
illusions, and claim proprietorial rights over the affections of those
weaker than themselves. Married men demand that their wives love
them faithfully and unreservedly - with what success, we know.
Fathers want their children to look up to them as if they were gods,
and if they do not receive as much love as they think they deserve,
they complain loudly about ingratitude. Lacking real affections,
they avidly absorb untruthful images and representations of their
lives. They like to be regaled with novels and plays that depict
orgies of filial love and conjugal fidelity, no shadow of which is to
be found in ordinary families . Civilised men, nourished on moral
fantasies of this sort, become incapable of studying the general laws
of nature; they see everything through their own capricious and
despotic assumptions, so they accuse nature of injustice without
77

The Theory of the Four Movements
showing any desire to find out what aims and purposes underlie its
organisation.
To discover what these aims and purposes are we have to move
on from ideas of duty to an analysis of that passionate attraction
which may seem depraved to us, as we do not know what its pur­
pose is, but which, depraved or not, has never been subjected to
thorough analysis.
To remind the reader to keep attraction separate from duty and
to study it with a completely open mind, I shall include a new
chapter about it, about the Composite Counter-Movements, in the
third part of this treatise. This will explain that because attraction
is irreducible, even though it contradicts duty, we must in the end
give in to its siren voice and study its laws. For as long as we
continue imposing ours upon it, attraction will always make fun of
them, to the triumph of God and the confusion of our ever­
changing systems.
[The tree of passion and its branches or
powers graduated in first, second, third,
fourth and fifth degreesY

Let us begin with the first degree, which has three branches; we
shall come to the trunk, or Unityism, later: this is regarded as the
source of all the passions, of which there are three at the first level,
twelve at the second, and so on.
At the first degree or the first division of the trunk there are
three sub-focal passions or centres of Attraction to which human
beings of all ranks and in all ages are drawn; these three passions
are:
1 st. Luxism, or the desire for luxury.
2nd . Groupism, or the desire for groups.
3rd. Seriism, or the desire for Series.
Let us examine these by subdividing them according to the number
of passions they give rise to at the next level, or the second power,
' 'This chapter is previously unpublished; reading it it is important to remember
that the additions in this new edition are not considered authorial emendations but
generally mere indications, preliminary notes not even made with the prospect of
a new edition in mind. All these additions were put down currente calamo and
indeed often in abbreviated form.' (Editors' note, 1 84 1 ) .

First part: The general destinies
which provides twelve branches which make up the passionate scale,
which is analogous to the scale in music.
1 st sub-focus: luxury. This provides and governs five secondary
passions, known as the sensory passions or the desires of the senses.
Luxury is both internal and external. It is internal as regards the
health which guarantees us the full and direct use of each sense;
but these cannot be exercised without the aid of wealth. It is no
good having a good stomach and a keen appetite if you have not
got the price of a meal. Anyone without the money is condemned
to starvation, to the indirect obstruction of the senses, and the
senses can therefore not achieve full indirect play without the
mediation of money, to which everything in Civilisation is
subordinated.
The other four senses are in the same position as taste: without
the support of wealth their scope is reduced to a minimum. There
would be no point in perfecting your ear if you had no money, for
you would be denied admission to concerts or to the opera, while
you saw coarse people with no ear for music allowed in because
they had well-filled purses. Internal luxury or health is therefore
not enough to achieve happiness: we also desire external luxury, or
wealth, which guarantees the free play of the senses, whereas
internal luxury guarantees only their conditional development.
Even the exception here proves the rule. A young woman finds
an old man who ensures that she has a happy life, full exercise of
certain sensual pleasures, good food, fine clothes and jewels, etc.,
which previously she lacked. In this case one of the five senses, the
fifth, rut-touch, intervenes to provide, by means of wealth, the
external exercise of the other four, which would only have had
internal exercise or health, a capacity merely, with no chance of
positive development, and which, without the aid of the wealth
provided by the old man, would have been reduced to all kinds of
deprivation, even perhaps of the sense of touch, for the very poor
have few means of obtaining the objects of their desire in love.
We can therefore see that luxury is compound rather than simple,
both external and internal; this is an important principle to establish
in order to show the imprecision of the Physical Sciences in all
questions relating to the Unity of Movement, as for example in the
debate on the simple or compound nature of light: if that were a
simple body, it would have to follow, from the Unity of nature, that
79

The Theory of the Four Movements
luxury were simple. It is the prime aim of Passionate Attraction, as
the pivot of light or the sun is the prime aim of Material Attraction.
But luxury being compound, as we have just seen, so also is light,
which is at least twofold in the system of nature, coinciding with
material and passionate Movement.
2nd sub-focus: the groups. This branch provides four secondary,
or affective, passions.
Major

Minor

1 . Group of Honour or Corporati o n
2 . Group of Friendship
3. Group of Love
4. Group of Family or Kinship

Our legislators want to subordinate the social system to the last of
these four groups, the Family, which God has almost entirely
excluded from influence in Social Harmony, because it is a group
of forced or material bonds, not a free, passionate gathering, dissol­
uble at will.
It is quite appropriate that people whose entire calculations are
against the grain of nature should have taken as the pivot of their
social mechanism the one group out of the four that will have the
least influence, because of its lack of freedom: thus it will have no
active use in Harmony save where it is absorbed into the other three
and operates through them.
Since all constraint engenders falsehood, it must be established
through the influence of the Family group, which is neither free
nor indissoluble. Thus both civilised and patriarchal society, where
this group is the dominant one, are the most duplicitous. Barbarous
society, which is more bloodthirsty and oppressive than ours, is
however less duplicitous, being less influenced by the Family group,
one of the greatest sources of duplicity to be found in the move­
ment. The indissolubility of its bonds makes it heterogeneous to
God's intentions, which are that attraction and freedom should be
the only powers governing ties and impulses.
3rd sub-focus: the Series or affiliations of groups leagued in Series,
enjoying the same properties as geometric Series. This third branch
provides three of the twelve secondary passions which are called
distributive and lead towards a social and domestic mechanism
entirely unknown in Civilisation. They were known to primitive
society, and they are the lost secret of happiness which has had to
be rediscovered. The calculus of Passionate Harmony therefore
80

First part: The general destinies
needs to be principally concerned with the art of forming and mech­
anising the Series of groups.
If scholars actually believed in the Unity of the Universe they
are always going on about they would have come to believe that, if
the whole Universe and all of its created products have been distrib­
uted by Series, we must establish a similar order in the play of
social and domestic passions if we want to achieve Unity ourselves.
They did not, however, want to admit this analogy, or to induce
the necessity for research into the formation of Passionate Series,
the secret of which I possess.
However, as I am not revealing it in this book, where I only deal
superficially with Series in Note A and in the 2nd Note in the
Second part, it seemed pointless to define the three passions that
lead to the formation of Series: what would be the use of describing
three new incentives without describing the use to be made of them
in social and domestic mechanics?
We shall frequently have occasion to draw attention to the div­
ision of the twelve secondary passions into five corporal or sensual
passions and seven spiritual passions, relating to the soul (the four
affective and the three distributive passions), and their collective
centre or passionate trunk, Unityism, the passion which includes
the three primary branches and is the result of their combined
development.
Unityism is the inclination of the individual to harmonise his
own happiness with that of everything around him and of the whole
human race, which today is so hateful. It is a boundless phil­
anthropy, a universal well-being, which will not be able to develop
until the whole human race is rich, free and just, in accord with
the three sub-focal passions, for Luxury, Groups and Series, which
require:
In their r st Development, progressive Wealth for the five
senses;
In their 2nd Development, absolute Freedom for the four
groups;
In their 3 rd Development, distributive Justice for the eponymous passions.
As well as these three primary passions, unityism also includes the
twelve secondary passions which are contained within the three pri­
mary. On this basis it might seem appropriate to compare Unityism

The Theory of the Four Movements
with white light, which contains the seven solar colours. But in fact
light rays contain five more colours that are invisible to us and are
not observable, pink, fawn, brown, dragoon-green and lilac (I can
only be entirely sure of the pink and the brown) . White light thus
actually contains twelve rays, only seven of which are revealed, just
as the musical octave contains twelve notes only seven of which are
articulated. It is therefore quite inexact to represent Unityism as a
bringing together of the seven passions of the soul, the affective
and distributive passions, since such a gathering presupposes the
full development of five sensory passions, and consequently the full
development of the twelve secondary passions.
This Prospectus does not offer a definition of Unityism, or the
root-stock of the passions, but as it is entirely undeveloped in Civi­
lisation all that is necessary is to direct our attention to the counter­
passion, or Egotism, which is so universally dominant that ideology,
the system of perfectible perfectibility, has made egotism or the self
the basis of all its calculations. Studies of Civilised Man have as a
rule observed nothing but the subversive passions, which have a
scale comparable to that of Harmony.
Our scholars are unaware of Unityism and boundless phil­
anthropy. All they have been able to make out instead is that
passion's subversive play or counter-development, the mania for
subordinating everything to our own individual convenience. Schol­
ars have a number of names for this odious characteristic: the moral­
ists call it Egotism, the ideologues call it the self, a new word which
says nothing new and is merely a pointless paraphrase of the Ego­
tism that civilised man has always been accused of, and rightly so
since his social state, governed by duplicity and oppression, subor­
dinates the twelve secondary passions to Egotism which thus
becomes a subversive focus and takes the place of Unityism or the
focal harmonic passion.
As our common aim, happiness, is the full development of Unity­
ism, which includes the full development of all the passions, we
shall need to simplify our study by relating the argument about
development to the three primary passions, Luxism, Groupism and
Seriism, or at least limiting it to the twelve secondary passions
which are subdivisions of the three primary.
There is no point in going into extended detail about the 32
tertiary passions at this early stage, still less the hundred and thirty82

First part: The general destinies
four quaternary ones, etc., as the complete development of the three
primaries assures the full development of the 32 tertiaries and the
1 34 quaternaries, etc.
In this prospectus, therefore, it will be quite sufficient to specu­
late on the development of the three primaries, called the sub-focals,
and the twelve secondaries, called the radicals of the passionate
octave and scale.
We are familiar with the five sensory passions tending to Luxury,
and the four affective passions that draw us towards groups: all we
need to do now is to familiarise ourselves with the three distributives,
the combined development of which produces the Series, the social
method whose secret has been lost since the time of the earliest
men, who were only able to sustain the Series for about three hun­
dred years. That mechanism has now at last been rediscovered along
with the arrangements necessary for its application to large-scale
industry.
Put in its simplest form, then, our task is to determine the play
of Seriism, or the third primary passion, because this is the one
which holds the other two, Luxism and Groupism, in balance: with­
out it, they would be permanently at odds with each other.
Harmony between these three produces happiness by assuring
the full development of Unityism, the trunk and root-stock of the
passions, and creates all the branches of different degrees.
I have told you about the scale or classification of its powers: but
let me repeat that the tree which springs from Unityism, a passion
unknown in our society, and which is the counter-march of Ego­
tism, provides 3 in the first power, 1 2 in the second, 32 in the third,
1 34 in the fourth, and 404 in the fifth, as well as the pivot, which
is never counted in Movement.
Temperaments and characteristics are classified according to the
same pattern, more or less: there are four temperaments in the
second degree in addition to the focus; the fourth degree may vary
from thirty to thirty-two, and similarly with the others.
This analysis of the passions, temperaments and characteristics
could be taken as far as the sixth, seventh and eighth powers. But
at this stage the fifth will be enough to satisfy your curiosity, as
that is the one which provides the whole range of the Phalanx of
Harmony or Domestic Destiny. I shall have more to say about this
in the treatise.

The Theory of the Four Movements
Like the Unity of the metrical and passionate universe, the
system of Attraction is faithfully portrayed and followed in sidereal
mechanics, where we can see thirty-two keys or planets of the key­
board gravitating in collective mode around Unityism, by the equi­
librium and harmony of the vortex and the starry sphere whose
centre it occupies. If we look at the subdivisions, starting with those
of the first degree, we can see that it gravitates around three
sub-foci:
1.
2.
3.

Luxury or the solar pivot.
The four Groups formed by the four planets with moons.
The Series formed by bracketing the four groups and the
ambiguous ones on the solar pivot.

We can now move on to outline the twelve passions in the radical
octave of the second power.
Passionate Attraction

There are three foci or aims of attraction which human passions
tend towards, at all levels of society and in all periods. They are as
follows:
1 st. Luxury of the five senses.
2nd. The progressive Series.
3rd. Universal unity.
The soul is driven ceaselessly towards these three aims by twelve
stimuli, or radical passions, which are the roots of all the others.
There are:
S

4

3

material passions or sensory appetites which lead us towards
luxury.
spiritual passions or simple appetites of the soul which lead us
towards links of affection, the four groups I mentioned earlier,
and the grouped Series.
refining passions or compound appetites of the soul which lead
to social and universal unity.

These last three passions, which I have called refining (and which
might be better designated by the term mechanising) are scarcely
known at all to Civilisation. Only a few glimmers have appeared on

First part: The general destinies
the horizon, j ust enough to arouse the anger of moralists in their
relentless war against pleasure. Their influence is so negligible and
their appearance so rare that they have not even been separately
classified: I have had to call them intermeshing, varying and gradu­
ating, but I prefer to designate them by the numbers 1 0 , 1 I and
1 2 ; and I shall postpone defining them because nobody would
imagine that God, for all his power, could ever create a social order
capable of satisfying three such insatiable passions for pleasure.
The seven spiritual and refining passions1 are more in the realm
of the soul than of matter: they are at the primitive level. Their
combined action creates one collective passion, the product of all
seven, in the same way as white is made by the union of the seven
colours of the spectrum. I shall call this thirteenth passion har­
monyism [or unityism]. It is even more unknown than the tenth,
eleventh and twelfth, which I have said nothing about, but it is
possible to consider their general influence without knowing any­
thing specific about them. This is what I am going to do.
Although these four passions - tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thir­
teenth - are stifled and suppressed completely by the conventions
of our Civilisation, the germ of their existence continues to live in
our souls, tiring or stimulating us according to individual levels of
activity. That is why so many civilised men spend their lives in
boredom, even though they may possess everything they desire.
Caesar is a good example: he became ruler of the world and yet
was amazed to find that his exalted position brought him nothing
but boredom and emptiness. The sole reason for Caesar's malaise
was the influence of the four suppressed passions, especially the
thirteenth which exercised a very potent stimulus on his soul . This
was exacerbated by the fact that, having attained this supreme rank,
he had nothing left to desire, nothing to distract him or divert him
from the controlling force of the thirteenth passion.
Almost all the great men of Civilisation have suffered the same
misfortune. Their souls are powerfully disturbed by the four pas­
sions having no chance to develop. It is hardly surprising, then,
that ordinary people are generally more satisfied with a modicum
of happiness than the great tend to be with their resplendent pleas­
ures. These much-vaunted trappings of greatness - the throne, sov' 'the seven affective and distributive passions' ( 1 841).
85

The Theory of the Four Movements
ereignty, etc. - are certainly real advantages, whatever the philo­
sophers say, but they characteristically irritate the four suppressed
passions instead of satisfying them, which is why the middle class
can extract more enjoyment from fewer resources. Its bourgeois
habits really only act as an irritant to the first nine passions, which
are allowed a degree of development in the civilised order, whereas
no scope at all is permitted to the three refining passions or to
harmonyism.

By and large the influence of the three refining passions produces
the sort of people who are accused of corruption, and labelled liber­
tines, debauchees, etc. The thirteenth, or harmonyism, produces
people regarded as geniuses or eccentrics, people who seem ill at
ease in their surroundings and who cannot adapt to the customs of
Civilisation.
Barbarians are entirely unaware of these four passions, as their
state of society does not arouse them at all; they are therefore more
content than we would be with their brutal customs which derive
from the nine physical and spiritual passions, the only ones they
feel.
In short, the reason why the human race can only find perfect
happiness in grouped Series or the combined order is that it assures
the full development of the twelve radical passions, and thus of the
thirteenth which is a composite of the principal ones. Whence it
follows that, in the new social order, the least fortunate men or
women will be far happier than the greatest king is today, because
the only true happiness consists in satisfying all one's passions.
The twelve radical passions are subdivided into a host of subtle
variations which exercise a greater or lesser influence over every
individual. This results in an infinite variety of characters, all of
which, however, can be related to the eight hundred principal types.
Nature distributes these randomly among the children of both
sexes, such that eight hundred randomly chosen children could pro­
vide the germ of all perfection that the human spirit can attain to.
Each one, that is, will be naturally endowed with abilities sufficient
to equal some outstanding historical figure such as Homer, Caesar,
Newton, etc. Thus if we divide the 36-million-strong population of
France by 800, we shall find that it contains 4 5 ,000 individuals
capable of equalling Homer, 4 5 ,000 capable of equalling
Demosthenes, etc., if only they had been taken up at the age of three
86

First part: The general destinies
and given a natural education to develop every germ distributed by
Nature. But this education can only happen in progressive Series
or the combined order. Then, given that France alone will provide
45,000 of each type of famous person, you can imagine the abun­
dance there will be in the new order. When the globe is organised
and its population has reached the grand total of 3 thousand million,
there will normally be 37 million poets equal to Homer, 37 million
geometricians equal to Newton, 37 million dramatists equal to
Moliere, and so on through all the talents imaginable. (These esti­
mates are approximate. )
It is therefore a great mistake t o think of nature a s miserly with
her talents: she is prodigal far beyond our needs or desires. But
you have to be able to uncover the seeds and develop them, and
you still know as little about that as savages do about finding and
exploiting mines. You have no skill, no touchstone that will enable
you to see what nature has destined people to be, what seeds have
been planted in their souls. Each germ is stifled and repressed by
civilised education so that scarcely one in a million escapes. The
art of finding them is one of the thousands of marvellous things
you will learn from the theory of progressive Series, in which every
individual will develop and perfect all the different embryonic tal­
ents distributed by nature.
Given that the eight hundred characters are distributed among
children at random, it is not surprising that sons often differ so
radically from their fathers (as witness the proverb: 'Miserly father,
spendthrift son') . This leads to a constant reversal of family inter­
ests: a father builds up a business by hard work and at great cost,
and then his son, whose interests are entirely different, neglects it,
lets it run down and finally sells it. Thus there are endless peror­
ations against nature on the part of fathers. The new social order
will justify all nature's apparent injustices, including the most
shocking ones like the abandonment of the poor, who are the less
protected for being in greater need of aid and work while the rich,
who lack for nothing, are swamped with fortune's favours and offers
of jobs. The influence of such an evil genius is evident in all
branches of Civilisation, revealing nature everywhere bent on harry­
ing the poor, the weak and the just. On all sides we are made aware
of the absence of a divine providence, and the permanent reign of
the demonic spirit that allows enough occasional glimmers of justice

The Theory of the Four Movements
for us to recognise that justice has been banished from civilised and
barbarous societies:
Je ne sais, de tout temps, quelle injuste puissance
Laisse la paix au crime et poursuit !'innocence . . .
Autour de moi, si je jette Jes yeux,
Je ne vois que malheurs qui condamnent !es Dieux.
[Racine, Andromaque]3

These temporary disorders will come to appear extremely wise
arrangements when the theory of attraction has enabled you to
recognise that the civilised order has the capacity to develop the
twelve radical passions in complete counter-march, constantly produc­
ing as many iniquities and horrors as these passions would produce
justice and benefits in their forward march and combined develop­
ment. You will admire the unbroken series of calamities with which
God overwhelms you, and which will continue as long as you persist
in living in industrial incoherence, and you will realise that the
apparent illogicality of the operation of the passions stems from
the profound designs by which God is preparing you for immense
happiness in the combined order. Finally you will see that passion­
ate attraction, accused by your philosophers of depravity and cor­
ruption, is the wisest and most wonderful of all God's works. It
alone, operating with no constraint and on no basis except the
allurements of sensual pleasure, will establish universal unity across
the globe and cause wars, revolutions, poverty and injustice to dis­
appear for the duration of the seventy-thousand-year period of
social harmony which we shall enter. I now return to the incoherent
societies in which we are living at the moment.
Characteristics, intermeshing and phases of the
social periods

Every social period has a fixed number of constituent characteristics
or properties; religious tolerance, for example, is characteristic of the
' 'I do not know what unjust power has always
Left the criminal in peace and pursued the innocent
If I look around me, all I see
Are miseries and misfortunes which condemn the Gods. '
Act m, scene 1 (slightly misquoted).
. . . .

88

First part: The general destinies
sixth period and not of the fifth, hereditary kingship is characteristic
of the fifth and not of the fourth, etc.
To say that the characteristics are drawn from the operation of
the seven primitive passions, and that they vary in number accord­
ing to the periods, would be to arouse a desire for a definition of
the seven primitive or radical passions which I do not want to deal
with in this first treatise. So limiting discussion to Civilisation, or
the fifth period, I will say that it has sixteen characteristics,
fourteeen of which are drawn from the backwards and forwards
operation of the seven primitive passions, and two from the inverse
development of the passion of harmonyism .
Every society is to a greater or lesser degree a mixture of charac­
teristics borrowed from the previous or subsequent periods. For
example, the French have recently adopted the unity of industrial
and administrative relations: this method, which is one of the charac­
teristics of the sixth period, was introduced by the uniform metric
system and the Napoleonic civil code, two institutions which run
contrary to the civilised order, one of the characteristics of which
is incoherence of industrial and administrative relations. In this area
we have therefore departed from Civilisation and enmeshed with the
sixth period. We have enmeshed with it at other points, too, notably
through religious tolerance. The English, who practise an intolerance
worthy of the twelfth century, are more civilised than we are in
this respect. The Germans are also more civilised than we are, in
terms of the incoherence of law, custom and industrial relations:
everywhere one goes in Germany one finds different measures,
different coins, and different laws and practices, as a result of which
strangers can be much more easily tricked and robbed than would
be the case if measures, coin, criminal code, etc. , were unified. This
chaos favours the civilised mechanism, as its aim is to raise decep­
tion to the highest level. It is what the fullest development of the
sixteen special characteristics of Civilisation should lead to.
Yet philosophers claim 'that we have improved Civilisation by
adopting religious tolerance and industrial and administrative
unity'. This is to put it very badly: what they should say is that
'we have improved the social order and damaged Civilisation'; indeed
if they gradually adopted all sixteen characteristics of the sixth
period it would result in the complete annihilation of Civilisation.
They would have destroyed it in the belief that they were improving

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
it. The social order would be better organised, but they would be
in the sixth period, not the fifth. These distinctions of characteristic
lead us to the entertaining conclusion that the paucity of good that
is to be found in the civilised order is simply due to the contrary arrange­
ments of Civilisation.
And if we want to make Civilisation even worse, we need to add
some characteristics of the patriarchate which are most compatible
with it; for example, the freedom of commerce, or the freedom to sell
false weights and false measures, or to provide false commodities,
like polished stones inside a shot casing. All these tricks are legally
permitted in China where all merchants give false measure and sell
false goods with impunity. You buy a fine-looking ham in Canton
and when you carve it you find nothing but a mass of earth cun­
ningly wrapped in slices of meat. Every merchant has three sets of
scales: one weighing light to trick purchasers, one weighing heavy
to trick salesmen, and one weighing correctly for his own use. If
you are taken in by this deception, the magistrates and the public
will laugh at you and tell you that there is commercial freedom in
China, and that this so-called vice has sustained the vast Chinese
empire for 4,000 years, more successfully than any empire in
Europe. We may conclude from this that the patriarchate and Civi­
lisation have nothing to do with truth or justice, and can sustain
themselves perfectly well without providing access to truth or
justice, the exercise of which is incompatible with the character of
those two societies.
Although I have not described the characteristics of different
periods I have given some indication of how every period often
adopts those of earlier or later ones. It is incontrovertibly a misfor­
tune to introduce characteristics from earlier periods, such as the
legal admission offalse measure, borrowed from the third period, or
the affiliation of clubs, which is a civil janissariat, and enmeshes with
the fourth period, or Barbarism.
It is not always an advantage to introduce characteristics from a
later period . In some cases they can be distorted by this political
transplantation, with unfortunate effects, as in the case of free
divorce which is a sixth-period characteristic, and which has pro­
duced so much disorder in Civilisation that very strict limits have
had to be imposed to it. Yet in the sixth period free divorce is a
very salutary practice and contributes greatly to domestic harmony,

First part: The general destinies
but this is because it is combined with other characteristics which
do not exist in Civilisation. It can therefore be seen that precautions
must be taken when a characteristic is transplanted from one period
to another, in the same way as when a plant is moved to a climate
that is not its own. It is a mistake to believe that unlimited religious
tolerance can suit civilised man; in the long term it would produce
more ill effects than good in agricultural states, if it were not that
it excludes religions that uphold the customs of the fourth, third
and second periods, such as Mohammedanism, Judaism and idol­
atry. It would make no difference if they were admitted now, as
Civilisation is close to its end.
Every incoherent society feels to some extent in need of the
characteristics of the next period, and none more keenly than Civil­
isation, which is overtly critical of its own characteristics, for
example of the duplicity which governs matters of love: plays, novels
and salons resound with mockery of it, as the same jokes, worn-out
by frequent repetition, reappear day after day as if they were new.
These are principally aimed at women, inappropriately so, as each
sex strives to outdo the other in the self-deception with which they
conduct their affairs. If men seem less deceitful it is because the
law allows them greater latitude and regards as gallantry in them
what in the weaker sex it deems a crime. It may be objected that
the consequences of infidelity are very different in the two sexes,
but they are the same if the woman is sterile, or if she keeps her
child without attributing its paternity to the father. If the law had
given women the right to free love in such cases we would have
seen a decline in sexual duplicity, object of our unjust jibes, and it
would have been both possible and practicable to adopt free divorce;
but as it is, civilised man, because of his tyrannical attitude towards
women, has failed to make the transition to the sixth period to
which the above-mentioned law would have led him.
A much easier way of leading men and women alike to complete
freedom and openness in affairs of love, and of bringing the whole
social body to sexual freedom, is by an indirect and purely economic
operation : the progressive household or nine-group tribe, which is the
domestic order of the seventh social period, which I shall be talking
about in the second part.
In every period there is a characteristic which forms the Pivot of
the mechanism and whose presence or absence determines the change
91

The Theory of the Four Movements
of period. This characteristic is always concerned with love: in the
fourth period it is the absolute servitude of women; in the fifth, exclus­
ive marriage and the wife 's civil liberties; in the sixth it is the amorous
corporation that ensures women the privilege I spoke of earlier. If
barbarians were to adopt exclusive marriage they would very soon
become civilised as a result of that one innovation; if we adopted
the confinement and sale of women we would rapidly become bar­
barians as a result of that one innovation; and if we were to adopt
amorous guarantees of the sort that will become established in the
sixth period we would, by this measure alone, find an escape from
Civilisation and an entry into the sixth period.
As a general rule the pivotal characteristic, which is always taken
from amorous custom, leads automatically to the creation of all the
others, but the secondary characteristics cannot give rise to the
pivotal one, and they can only bring about a change of period very
slowly. Barbarians could adopt up to twelve of the sixteen civilised
characteristics and still remain barbarians if they failed to adopt the
pivotal characteristic, the civil liberty of an exclusive wife.
The reason why God has given amorous custom so much influ­
ence over the social mechanism and the transformations it
undergoes is because he abhors violence and oppression. It was his
will that the happiness or unhappiness of human societies should
be proportionate to the degree of constraint or liberty they allowed.
But God only acknowledges freedom that encompasses both sexes,
not merely one, and therefore he decided that those seed-beds of
social atrocity, savagery, barbarism and Civilisation, should only
have a single pivot, the subjection of women; and that all the periods
which produce social well-being, like the sixth, seventh and eighth
periods, should have no pivot, no point of orientation, except the
progressive liberation of the weaker sex.
These are truths that the inhabitants of Civilisation will remain
unaware of. They j udge women according to current attitudes,
according to the dissimulation our customs force upon them by
refusing them freedom. They believe duplicity to be the natural,
unchanging attribute of the female sex. Yet if we can already see
such a marked difference between the women in our capital cities
and concubines in a seraglio, who think of themselves as automata
created for men's pleasure, how much greater a difference would
there be between our ladies and those of a truly civilised nation in
which the female sex was elevated to complete freedom! And what
92

First part: The general destinies
characteristics would freedom develop among such women? These
are questions the philosophers are careful never to raise; actuated
by a spirit of oppression, a secret antipathy to women, they dull
women's minds with insipid compliments so they never question
their servitude. They stifle even the idea of finding out how women
might behave in a social order which would diminish their bondage.
There are always four phases in each of the thirty-two periods of
the Social Movement. Consequently, every social period, whether
barbarism, Civilisation or whatever, can be divided into four ages:
infancy, growth, decline and decrepitude, or decay. In the third part
of this treatise I shall provide a table of the four phases of Civilis­
ation; it is currently in the third phase, in decline, a term which I
shall explain.
A society can fall into decline as an effect of its social progress.
The savages of the Sandwich Islands and of Ohio who adopt some
elements of agricultural or manufacturing industry are obviously
improving the social state, but by the same token they are distancing
themselves from the savage order, which numbers among its
characteristics an aversion to agriculture. These tribes in the Sand­
wich Islands and Ohio thus reveal a savagery in decline as a conse­
quence of social improvement.
In the same way we can say that the Ottomans are barbarians in
decline, because they are adopting various characteristics of Civilis­
ation, such as a hereditary monarchy and other customs which,
being close to civilised practices, constitute a decline of barbarism.
Before Selim was deposed they had adopted military tactics charac­
teristic of Civilisation: they improved their barbarism by sup­
pressing the organised troops, the adoption of which was an anti­
barbarian measure and an enmeshing with Civilisation.
These examples should suffice to expl ai n what I said above,
namely that a society can fall into decline as an effect of social progress.
The first, second and third societies deteriorate as they decline
because their decline brings them closer to the fourth, barbarism,
which is the worst of all. But the fourth, fixth, sixth and seventh
societies gain ground as they decline because their decline brings
them closer to the eighth, which is the gateway to the combined
order.
The four phases of infancy, growth, decline and decay each have
particular attributes. For example, the first phase of Civilisation is
marked by exclusive marriage combined with the slavery of agricultural
93

The Theory of the Four Movements
workers; that was the order which existed among the Greeks and
Romans, who were only in the first phase of Civilisation. The
second and third phases also have their own attributes; when I indi­
cate the attributes of the four phases of Civilisation, it will be clear
that the philosophers have attempted to retard it and keep it in the
phase of infancy, that it is only chance which has led us from the
first to the second, and from the second to the third phase, and that
following this progress the philosophers have been sufficiently skil­
ful to claim responsibility for improvements which they never dre­
amed of until led to them by the workings of chance.
I have already proved this by observing that no Greek or Roman
philosopher put forward plans for the emancipation of slaves; they
never concerned themselves with the condition of those wretches
Vedius Pollio fed alive to his lampreys for the slightest misdemean­
our, or with the thousands slaughtered by the Spartans to reduce
their numbers when they multiplied too quickly. Never did the
philanthropists of Athens or Rome condescend to take an interest
in their fate, or protest against these atrocities. In that epoch they
believed that Civilisation could not exist without slaves; and philo­
sophers still believe that social science has reached its ultimate state,
and that the best we know is the best there can ever be. Thus,
seeing that the civilised order is a little less bad than the savage or
barbarous orders, they have concluded that Civilisation is the best
possible society and that it is impossible to discover any other kind.
Between the different social periods there are mixed or hybrid
societies, which are equally divided between the characteristics of
several periods. Russian society is a mixture of fourth and fifth
periods, of barbarism and Civilisation. Chinese society is the most
curious on the globe, as far as being mixed is concerned, because it
contains characteristics of patriarchate, barbarism and Civilisation
in almost equal quantity. The Chinese are therefore neither patri­
archal, nor barbaric, nor civilised .
Mixed societies like the Russian and the Chinese have the
properties of cross-bred animals like the mule: they have more vices
but also more vigour than the original societies which they are
divided between.
It is extremely rare, indeed almost impossible, to find a pure
society, unadulterated, and with no characteristics borrowed from
earlier or later periods. I have said that the barbarians of Asia have
94

First part: The general destinies
almost all adopted hereditary monarchies, a characteristic of Civilis­
ation and a departure from the barbaric order, which is purest in
Algiers where the throne belongs legally to the first occupant. I have
already remarked that our society includes several ultra-civilised
arrangements, and I shall end on this proposition, which would
require a complete exposition of the characteristics of every period,
particularly of the sixteen characteristics of Civilisation, and the
special attributes of the four phases of each period.
On the happiness and unhappiness of globes during
the phases of social incoherence

Happiness, about which so much, or rather so much nonsense, has
been talked, consists in having many passions and many means of
satisfying them. We have few passions and hardly sufficient means
to satisfy a quarter of them; this is why our globe is for the moment
one of the most miserable in the universe. Other planets may per­
haps experience equal unhappiness, but none can suffer more, and
the theory of movement will prove that God, despite his power,
cannot invent more refined social torments than the ones we endure
on this miserable globe.
I shall not provide any further enlightenment on this subject,
save to observe that the most unhappy planet of a vortex is not
always the poorest. Venus is poorer than we are, and Mars and the
three new planets are even poorer, yet their lot is less distressing
than ours, for the following reason.
The most unfortunate star is that whose inhabitants have passions
disproportionate to the means of enjoying them: this is the vice
which at present afflicts our globe. It renders the situation of the
human race so wearisome that signs of discontent are visible at
every level, even that of sovereigns who, enjoying a universally
envied position, still complain of unhappiness, despite being free
to change places with any of their subjects.
I explained the reason for this temporary malaise earlier: God
gave our passions an intensity suited to the two phases of combined
order, comprising roughly seventy thousand years, in the course of
which each new day will provide pleasures so active and so various
that our souls will scarcely be able to cope with them; we shall be
obliged methodically to refine children's passions to make them
95

The Theory of the Pour Movements
ready to taste the countless pleasures which the new social order
will bring with it.
If our destiny extended no further than the wretchedness of Civil­
isation, God would have given us listless, apathetic passions of the
sort recommended by philosophers, passions appropriate to the mis­
erable existence of the last five thousand years. But their vitality,
which we compain about, is the guarantee of our future happiness.
God had to shape our souls for the ages of happiness which will
last seven times longer than the ages of unhappiness. The prospect
of five or six thousand years of preparatory torment was not enough
of a motive to decide God to give us lifeless, philosophical passions
which would have suited the miseries of Civilisation or barbarism
but which would have been entirely inappropriate to the seventy
thousand years of combined order we are going to pass into. From
today, therefore, we should give thanks to God for the intensity of
our passions, of which we were so absurdly critical while we were
ignorant of the social order which could develop and satisfy them.
Ought God to have obviated our ignorance by granting us the
faculty of glimpsing our glorious destiny? Certainly not. That
knowledge would have been a source of continual sorrow for our
forebears because the imperfect state of their industry would neces­
sarily have kept them in the incoherent order. Being able to foresee
the happiness the future held in store, they would nonetheless have
fallen into savagery, for there could be no possibility of organising
the combined order before industry and luxury were raised to a
much higher level, far beyond the capacity of the 1 st period . Many
centuries were needed to create the abundance the combined order
requires; and our forefathers would not have been willing to
improve industry for the benefit of generations who would not be
born for several thousand years. People would have been gripped
by a general apathy; no man would have wanted to work to prepare
for a state of well-being so distant that neither the living nor their
children's children could hope to enjoy it. Even with the much­
vaunted rationalism of today, people are reluctant to embark on
some enterprises, such as forest plantation, because the enjoyment
of their benefits is a generation away; so how could our forefathers
have agreed to work on projects whose fruits would not be available
for more than a thousand years? Because a period of at least twenty
centuries was needed to raise industry, science and the arts to the

First part: The general destinies
degree of improvement required to construct the combined order.
So what would have happened if the first men had foreseen this
future social harmony and realised that it would not be created
without very many centuries of industrial progress? It is very prob­
able that, far from working for a future twenty centuries removed,
they would have taken pleasure in putting obstacles in its way, and
that they would all have agreed in saying, 'Why should we now be
the servants of people who will not be born for another two thou­
sand years? Let us abandon, let us stifle at birth, this industry that
only they will benefit from; we are to be denied the happiness
reserved for the combined order, so why should our successors be
any better off in two thousand or twenty thousand years? Let them
live as we have lived. ' Is this not how human nature operates, as
witness the way fathers carp at their children for enjoying levels of
luxury they never had when they were young? Nobody would want
to work for their heirs if they thought they would never live to
enjoy the fruits of their labours themselves. The reason why I can
announce the proximity of universal harmony with so much assur­
ance is that the organisation of the societary state requires no more
than two years from the time when a canton prepares the buildings
and plants the crops; this wonderful social order will be created
immediately, as long as the arrangements have been made some­
where, and there are buildings and fields that can be allocated to a
phalanx of progressive Series. So given that the preparation of the
first canton will take, at most, two years, and that even the most
decrepit old men can always hope for another two years, they will
be pleased at the idea of organising progressive Series and seeing
them before they die, adapting Simeon's canticle perhaps: 'O Lord,
now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen the birth of the social order thou hast prepared for the salvation
of all peoples. '
Now, too, man can quit life without regret i n certain knowledge
of the soul's immortality, an assurance which only the invention of
the laws of Social Movement has made possible. Hitherto we have
had such vague notions of the afterlife, and such frightening pict­
ures of it, that immortality has been more a cause of terror than
a consolation. Belief was very weak, nor was there any reason to
suppose it would become stronger. God does not allow globes that
are still in the incoherent order to acquire definite ideas about the
97

The Theory of the Four Movements
afterlife of the soul, because if everyone was convinced of it all the
poorest members of Civilisation would kill themselves the moment
they were assured of having another life, as it could not be worse
than this one is for them. Only the rich would be left, and they
would have neither the desire nor the ability to take over the thank­
less functions of the poor. With the death of all those who bore its
burden, civilised industry would collapse, and that globe would
remain permanently in the savage state, simply because of a belief
in eternal life.
But God needs to retain civilised and barbarous societies for a
certain time as a route to other and better ones, and so he has had
to keep us in profound ignorance of immortality during Civilisation;
he had to ensure that calculations of the certainty of another life
were identical with those providing the means of rising to a better
state than barbarism or Civilisation, for the duration of the period
when most wage-earners [and slaves] would have committed suicide
if they could have counted with absolute certainty on an afterlife
which they saw simply as an opportunity to escape from appalling
poverty.
This question of the pleasure reserved for souls in another life
reveals civilised man's absolute ignorance of nature's perspectives.
How little you know, when you place future happiness in the separ­
ation of the spiritual from material! And when you claim that souls,
at the death of the body, abandon the material form without the
assistance of which not even God would experience pleasure! The
only enlightenment it is appropriate to give you on the subject of
the afterlife is to correct your mistaken view that there is some
disharmony between the living and the dead. Stop believing that
the souls of the dead have nothing to do with this world: there are
connections and relations between the two sorts of life; it will be
demonstrated to you that the souls of the dead vegetate in a state
of apathy and anxiety which ours will join in after this life until
the present order of the globe is improved. As long as the earth
remains in social chaos, so far removed from God's designs, the
souls of its inhabitants will suffer in the afterlife as they do in this
one; the happiness of the dead will only begin, like that of the living,
when the horrors of the savage, barbarous and civilised states have
ended.
98

First part: The general destinies
This revelation might be irritating, or even unbearable, if there
was any difficulty about organising this combined order, with its
promise of happiness for the dead and the living; but the fact that
it is extremely easy to establish the new order gives particular value
to the theories which remove our illusions about the afterlife, where
all we would have done hitherto would be to share the unease and
disquiet which the souls of our forefathers are burdened with, as
they wait for the societary organisation of the globe.
By making you aware of the fate which awaits your souls in the
various worlds they will pass through during eternity, the theory of
Social Movement will explain that after this life souls are reunited
with matter, and are never cut off from material pleasures. It is not
the place here to discuss this issue, nor to talk about why we temp­
orarily lose the memory of their previous existence, of what they
did before this life. Where were they before they inhabited our
bodies? God creates nothing out of nothing and so cannot have
made our souls out of nothing: and if you believe that they have no
pre-corporeal existence you are very close to believing that they
return to the void from which your prejudices would have them
emerge. Civilised man exposes his inconsistency when he argues
that the soul can be immortal after life, but not before it. Barbarians
and savages are closer to the truth in their crude tales of metem­
psychosis, a dogma which though muddled does include the follow­
ing two points: first, souls are not created out of nothing, and
second, souls are not separated from matter either before or after
this life. At least two glimmers of truth are therefore to be found
in the popular fictions of barbarism, nor is this the first time that
brute nations have shown more good sense than Civilisation in its
pride. For all civilised men's boasting about perfectibility, every
improvement results in them getting bogged down more and more
deeply in the darkness of ethics, politics and metaphysics, and run­
ning the risk of spending another thousand years wallowing in the
mire of Civilisation.
P.S. In this outline I have avoided mentioning anything about
the animal and organic movements, which I do not intend to explain
until later treatises, as it is necessary first to understand the Theory
of Son'al Movement, which they are co-ordinated with. But as some
desire for a note on the two animal and organic movements has

99

The Theory of the Four Movements
been expressed, with some examples to support their definition, I
shall comply by appending a chapter to the third section, dealing
with the hieroglyphic relationship between these two movements
and the human passions and social mechanism.

I OO

Epilogue: On the proximity of the social
metamorphosis
What suspicions are likely to be aroused in people's minds as they
reflect on this outline of past and future revolutions! At first they
will be torn between curiosity and distrust, attracted by the idea of
penetrating the mysteries of nature but afraid of being taken in by
a clever fiction. Reason will tell them to doubt, while passion urges
them to believe. Amazed to see a mere mortal unrolling the map
of divine decrees before their eyes, providing a survey of eternity
past and future, they will succumb to curiosity, they will tremble
at the idea that a man has finally been able to
Derober au destin ses augustes secrets;4
and before the announcement of the experiment, even before the
publication of my theory, I may well have more disciples to calm
down than sceptics to convince.
The idea of the General Destinies I have just sketched in is too
superficial not to provoke hundreds of objections, all of which I can
foresee because they have frequently been raised in lectures where
I have been able to provide much fuller answers than I am able to
do in this treatise. So it would be quite pointless for me to try to
allay these doubts until after I have explained the mechanism of
progressive Series, which will clarify whatever is obscure and settle
all conceivable objections.
Until then I shall do no more than remind you that the first two
treatises will not be concerned with the theory of Social Movement.
' 'Unlock the majestic secrets of destiny.'
IOI

The Theory of the Four Movements
Their only purpose will be to gratify people's impatience by provid­
ing a few glimpses of what people want to know (as I have done
in the introduction), outlining the impending consequences of the
combined order, and satisfying those enthusiasts who want to antici­
pate the publication of the treatise by receiving some indications
that the theory of the destinies really has been discovered .
We are always prepared to believe in what we desire, and many
readers will have complete trust in the discovery without expecting
any fuller explanation; and it is because I want to sustain their hopes
and strengthen the hope of those who are still hesitant that I have
laid so much stress on the ease with which humankind can move
immediately to the combined order. It is so easy in fact that this
year
1 808 could see the beginning of the organisation of the
globe; if a prince were to employ one of the armies now inactive
as result of the peace in a prototype canton, setting twenty thousand
men to the preparatory work needed, they could, by transplanting
the trees with their roots still in their native soil (as they do in
Paris), and by only building in brick, they could speed the process
up so much that the first phalanx of progressive Series would be in
operation by the end of spring 1 808. Then the chaos of savagery,
barbarism and Civilisation would vanish instantly from the earth,
taking with them the unanimous curses of mankind.
This shows how entirely right we are to shake off the lethargy,
the apathetic resignation to misfortune and the discouragement
spread by the philosophic dogmas that argue that providence has
no influence over the social mechanism and that the human spirit
has no power to determine our future destination.
For if the calculus of future events is beyond the grasp of man,
whence comes the obsessive desire, common to all peoples, to probe
the destinies, at the name of which even the most glacially detached
individuals feel a trembling of impatience? This shows how imposs­
ible it is to eradicate the passion to know the future from the human
heart. Why should God, who never does anything without a pur­
pose, give us this burning desire, if he had not provided the means
for satisfying it one day? Now at last that day has come, and mortals
will share with God a foreknowledge of future events; and I have
offered you this slender glimpse of them so that you will conclude
that, as this wonderful and much-desired knowledge has to do with
the theory of agricultural association and passionate attraction,
-

-

1 02

First part: The general destinies
nothing is more worthy of stimulating your curiosity than the
theory of association and attraction which is about to be communi­
cated to you in the following treatises, and which will open for you
the great book of the eternal decrees.
According to the philosophers, 'Nature is concealed under a
brazen veil, that the united efforts of men and ages can never lift
up the extremity of this covering. ' 5 A very useful sophism for ignor­
ance and vanity, trying to persuade people, as it does, that what
has not been done can never be done. If nature is veiled, it is not
with brass but with gauze; Newton's discovery of the fourth branch
of her mysteries is an indication that we were not meant to be
denied knowledge of the other three branches. When a beauty
grants her lover one favour he would be very foolish to think she
will not grant him any more. Why then have the philosophers given
up on nature when she aroused them by letting them lift up a corner
of her veil?
They boast about shedding streams of light everywhere, but
where is this enlightenment's source? It cannot be in nature because
nature, they say, is 'impenetrable to them and covered in a veil
of brass' . It is in radiant paradoxes like this that the philosophers
communicate their own discouragement and persuade humankind
that where their science has been unable to discover anything there
is nothing to be discovered.
Yet for all the incompetence of guides such as these, the social
order still makes some progress, as in the abolition of slavery; but
how slowly it recognises the good and puts it into into practice!
Twenty centuries of scientific knowledge elapsed before the slight­
est amelioration in the lot of slaves was proposed. Thus it takes
thousands of years for them to open our eyes to a truth, and suggest
an act of justice! Our sciences, which pride themselves on love for
the people, are utterly bankrupt when it comes to protecting them;
modern attempts to emancipate the negroes have achieved nothing
but bloodshed and exacerbation of the misery of those it was
designed to help, and people are still unaware of the methods of
emancipation, although modern customs have shown it to be a
possibility.

The Theory of the Four Movements
I repeat, we owe what little social progress we have made to
chance, not to moral and political science. But chance only allows
these discoveries at the cost of centuries of tumultuous failed
attempts. The progress of our societies is rather like that of the
sloth, whose every step is marked by a groan; like the sloth, Civilis­
ation moves forward with unimaginable slowness, from one political
torment to the next. It tries new systems in each generation but,
like thorn-bushes, all they do is stain the people who grasp them
with blood.
Wretched nations, you are very close to the great metamorphosis
which seemed to be announced by a universal upheaval. Today the
present is indeed pregnant with the future, and excessive suffering
must be leading towards the moment of salvation. From the contin­
ual sequence of vast political tremors it looks as if nature is straining
to shake off an oppressive burden. Wars and revolutions are con­
stantly flaring up in every corner of the globe; no sooner is one
disturbance warded off than another rises from its ashes, like the
Hydra's heads multiplying bene11th Hercules' sword. Peace is no
more than a glimmer, a momentary dream. Industry has become a
torturer of whole peoples, with an island of buccaneers impeding
communications, demoralising the cultivation of both continents
and transforming their workshops into breeding-grounds for beg­
gars. Colonial ambitions have created a new, smouldering volcano;
the implacable fury of the negroes will soon turn America into a
huge graveyard, avenging the annihilated native races by torturing
their conquerors. The mercantile spirit has opened new opportunit­
ies for crime; with every war its ravages extend over both hemi­
spheres and take the scandal of Civilisation's greed into the heart
of the savage regions. Our ships circumnavigate the globe for no
other reason than to make barbarians and savages party to our vices
and our furies. Civilisation does indeed become more hateful as it
approaches its fall. All the Earth offers today is hideous political
chaos which demands the strength of a new Hercules to purge it
of the social monstrosities which disfigure it.
This new Hercules is here. His great labours have already caused
his name to resound from pole to pole, and humanity, accustomed
by him to the sight of marvellous deeds, awaits a miracle which
will alter the fate of the world. Peoples, your presentiments will
soon be realised. The most glorious mission is reserved for the

First part: The general destinies
greatest of heroes. He it is who shall raise universal harmony on
the ruins of barbarism and Civilisation. Breathe again, forget your
former sorrows. Rejoice, for a happy discovery at last brings you
the Social Compassm which you might have discovered on a thousand
occasions if you had not all been so moulded by godlessness, so
culpably distrustful of providence. Learn (and I cannot repeat this
often enough) that it had above all to deal with the organisation of the
social mechanism because that is the noblest branch of the universal
movement whose direction belongs entirely and alone to God.
Instead of acknowledging the truth of this, instead of devoting
yourselves to discovering what God's designs for the social order
are and how he can reveal them to us, you have rejected every
argument which might have admitted God's intervention in human
affairs. You have vilified and defamed passionate attraction, the eter­
nal interpreter of his decrees, and entrusted yourselves to the guid­
ance of the philosophers who tried to relegate the divinity to a level
below their own, arrogating his highest function to themselves by
setting themselves up as regulators of Social Movement. To cover
them in shame, God allowed humanity to bathe in blood, under
their auspices, for twenty-three scientific centuries, and to run the
full gamut of misery, ineptitude and crime. And as a final disgrace
God has decided that these modern Titans should be brought down
by a discoverer from outside the realm of the sciences, and that it
should fall to the lot of a near-illiterate to reveal the theory of uni­
versal movement. It is a shop-sergeant who is going to confound
all the voluminous writings of the politicians and moralists, the
shameful products of ancient and modern quackery. And this is not
the first time that God has made use of the humb'le to put down
the proud and mighty, nor the first time that he has chosen the
obscurest man to bring the most important message to the world.

The Social Compass. This name is extremely appropriate for the progressive series
because this simple operation resolves all concei··able problems of social happiness,
and is enough on its own to guide human politics through the labyrinth of the
passions, just as a compass needle is enough on its own to guide ships through
the darkness of storms and the vastness of the seas.

Descriptions of the various branches of the
private or domestic destinies
Argument

There is light on the horizon: we are moving on to dissertations
which will contain nothing scientific and which will be comprehen­
sible to everybody.
In the first part I gave the curious a glimpse of the great phenom­
ena to come. Here, for pleasure-lovers, is a glimpse of the various
pleasures which the combined order can permit them to enjoy in
this present generation, as soon as it is organised. I emphasise how
close at hand this good fortune is because nobody likes delays where
pleasure is concerned, especially in a time when so much unhap­
piness has made everyone so eager for it.
By giving some advance sketches of the happiness that is impend­
ing, my already expressed intention is to awaken the reader's inter­
est in the theory of association and attraction which promises so
many delights, and to make him want the theory to be practicable.
As people come to desire the truth and accuracy of the calculus,
they will gradually get used to examining and studying this attrac­
tion on which such large hopes are founded.
Accordingly, I intend to reveal my theory just a little at a time,
disseminating it imperceptibly in each treatise, only bringing it all
together as a body of doctrine later. In brief, I mean to make the
amounts of theory proportionate to the amount of curiosity I am
1 07

The Theory of the Four Movements
able to arouse. I believe these precautions are necessary in order to
ensure a welcome for a treatise which would be ignored, like all
metaphysics, if I suddenly produced it all at once, without preparing
the way.
My difficulty in providing some outline descriptions of the com­
bined order will lie not in finding enough to say, but in keeping
the picture sketchy, in only lifting a corner of the curtain. If these
pictures were presented without a degree of caution they would, as
I have said, arouse too much enthusiasm, especially among women;
and my aim is to make my readers think rationally, not to titillate
them, as I would if I allowed them to see the full glory of the
combined order.
So in the sketches that follow I shall gloss over anything to do
with pleasure, and only bring it to your attention where it is necess­
ary for the critique of the tedium or absurdity of Civilisation. The
viewpoint will be derived from two descriptive accounts: the first,
drawn from the seventh period, will deal with household pleasures
in that society, and the inconveniences and discontents of the
household in Civilisation; the second account, drawn from the
eighth period, will deal with the splendour of the combined order.
In order to minimise the shock, I shall start gradually with a
picture drawn from the seventh period where, although the pleas­
ures are immense in comparison with our own, they are still moder­
ate in comparison with those of the combined order, which I shall
only talk about in the second account. There will be nothing shock­
ing in the first, nor, unlike the second, will it provoke any
accusations that it is absurd, out ofproportion or impossible.

First Account: On the progressive household
of the seventh period , and on the discontents
of the sexes in the incoherent household
The progressive household I am going to describe is a domestic
order belonging to the seventh and twenty-sixth periods, occupying
a position midway between the incoherent household of barbarism
and Civilisation and the combined household which reigns during
the eighteen periods of universal harmony.
In the progressive household, men [and women] enjoy such an
agreeable and comfortable existence that it would be impossible to
persuade any of them to embark on the kind of permanent marriage
which isolated households require.
Before speaking of the customs which arise as a result of the
absence of marriage, I shall examine the reasons for civilised man's
blind prejudice in favour of permanent marriage.
It must be remembered that I admit the necessity of this bond
in Civilisation and that I am criticising it by comparison with the
new social order, in which different circumstances will call for a
freedom in love which is inadmissible in our society. It must also be
remembered that on matters of marriage, household life and other
questions you should assume an exception of one-eighth from my
general assertions.
Order of matters dealt with in the First Account

On the discontents of men in incoherent households.
On the progressive household or nine-group tribe.

On the method of union of the sexes in the seventh period.
On the degradation of women in Civilisation.
On the correctives which will have led into the sixth period, such

On the vices of the system which oppresses love.
N.B. This account having turned out to be longer than planned, I
drew up this division after it was written. The subject matter is
therefore n ot fully organ ised under the different headings.
The discontents of men in incoherent households

If one thinks of the countless disasters that accompany household
life and permanent marriage it is amazing that the male sex are so
gullible that they have never thought about ways of freeing them­
selves from that sort of life. Apart from among the rich, it seems
to me that for the husband domestic life is as far removed from
pleasure as it can be; and I want to cite eight sources of annoyance,
among others, which affect all husbands to a greater or lesser extent,
and which will disappear in the progressive household .
I.

Random unhappiness. There can be no more fearful game of
chance than the indissoluble bond in which the risk of incom­
patibility between two characters can determine happiness or
unhappiness in life.
Expense. I n the current order this i s enormous, a s the huge
savings resulting from the progressive household will convince
you.
Vigilance. The obligation t o keep a n eye o n the detailed running
of a household, when it is unwise to leave it blindly in the
hands of the housewife.
Monotony. There is bound to be a great deal of this in isolated
households, as husbands, despite the distractions of their work,
flock to public places, cafes, clubs, theatres etc. to find some
relaxation from the satiety which proverbially comes from
always eating from the same dish. The monotony is much worse
for wives.
Sterility. This threatens to frustrate all plans for happiness, sets
husbands and wives against their parents, gives their patrimony
to relatives whose greed and ingratitude drives the original

legatees to despair, fills them with loathing for their sterile mate
and for the conjugal knot which has disappointed all their
expectations.
Widowerhood. This reduces the husband to the role of a drudge,
which is far worse than the minor annoyances of celibacy. And
if you precede your wife to the grave, anxiety for your children
left in mercenary hands and the thought of the disasters which
will overtake your young family will steep your last moments
in gall and bitterness.
Alliance. The calamity o f entering into a relationship with famil­
ies whose subsequent conduct seldom fulfils the hopes of bene­
fit or pleasure that were originally based on kinship with them.
Finally cuckoldry, which is a most tiresome accident as one takes
exhaustive precautions to avoid it, despite the certainty all hus­
bands have, before they marry, that they too will suffer the
general fate which they have inflicted on so many others."

Given all these misfortunes attaching to the state of marriage and
isolated households, why have men not done more to seek to escape
from such a degree of servitude, and instigated some domestic innov­
ations, which could not have produced anything more unfortunate
than present household life?
In politics it is said that might is right, but it is very different in
domestic matters. The male is the stronger, but by establishing iso­
lated households, and the permanent marriage which is its concomi­
tant, he has not shaped the law to his own advantage. It is as if this
order were the work of a third sex which wanted to condemn the other
two to a life of discontent: could anything better than the isolated
household and permanent marriage have been invented to introduce
dullness, venality and treachery i n to relations of love and pleasure?
Marriage seems to have been invented to reward perversity. The
more guileful and seductive a man is, the easier it is for him to achieve
wealth and public esteem through marriage; and the same is true of
women. Use all the lowest tricks to catch a rich husband and the
moment you are married you become a little saint, a sweet wife, a
model of virtue. Suddenly acquire a huge fortune by exploiting a
young lady and the consequence is so pleasing that everyone is pre­
pared to forgive a fine lad anything, if he can pull off a trick like that.

The Theory of the Four Movements
Everyone declares him a good husband, a good son, a good father, a
good brother, a good son-in-law, a good relation, a good friend, a good
neighbour, a good citizen and a good republican. That is the style of
our modern apologists; they cannot praise anyone without pronounc­
ing him good from head to foot, and in every other respect. Public
opinion operates in the same way if a knight ofindustry marries a sum
of money. A rich marriage is like a baptism in the rapidity with which
it effaces all previous defilement. Thus fathers and mothers in Civilis­
ation have nothing better to do than to incite their children to use
every means in their power, fair or foul, to make a rich marriage,
because marriage is a real civil baptism which, in the eyes of social
opinion, wipes out all sin. Society does not regard other forms of
wealth-making with the same indulgence, and never ceases to remind
the rest of the newly rich of the shameful ways they came by their
fortune.
But for every one who finds happiness through a wealthy
marriage, there are countless others who find nothing in the bond but
a lifetime of torture. They can see that the subjugation of women is
not in any way to men's advantage. How gullible the male sex is to
allow itself to wear a chain which it regards with such horror, and
what a punishment this bond inflicts on man for reducing woman to
servitude.
Although household life can guarantee some of the comforts lack­
ing in celibacy, it never provides any positive happiness," even in the
event of perfect harmony between man and wife, for if they are par­
ticularly well-matched nothing would prevent them from living
together in an order in which love was free and domestic society dif­
ferently organised. It will be clear from the picture of a new domestic
order that marriage cannot offer a single chance of happiness which
the couple could not find if they were completely free.
To keep us quiet about the obvious incongruence between
marriage and the passions, philosophy preaches fatalism, spreading
the word that we are destined to tribulation in this life, and that we
' I make an exception of cases where people acquire large fortunes through marriage;

but there are also ways of attaining fortune by amorous alliances in the state of
freedom and the progressive household. As for other pleasures, marriage can pro­
vide none which are not more readily available in the societary order, where even
the very old will find ample opportunity to exercise all their affections without
being exposed to the treachery and mockery that pursues people in civilisation as
they get older until they are old enough to be disregarded altogether.
I I2

Second part: The priz,ate or domestic destinies
must be able to resign ourselves to it, etc. Absolutely not! All you
need to do is discover a new sort of domestic society adapted to the
wishes of the passions, which is precisely what nobody has ever
proposed or sought. I intend shortly to put you on the right track
and give you a glimpse of this new private life whose discovery was
so easy.
But let us continue now with the discontents of the isolated
household and permanent marriage. This order characteristically
keeps us away from all aspects of positive happiness, from real pleas­
ures like amorous freedom, good living, freedom from worry and
other pleasures that civilised man does not even dream of envying
because philosophy has made them used to treating the desire for the
true good as a vice.
Despite the trouble they take to prepare us and soften us up for
marriage, in the same way as you might wheedle a child into taking
medicine, despite all their favourable, honeyed insinuations about
the happiness of the household, we still find men who are terrified
of the thought of marriage, especially those who have reached the
age of reflection. The marriage-knot must indeed be a fearful one,
as men shudder at the prospect several years in advance. I am not
talking about unions of the rich: everything is rosy in households
which start off with a good income, although even there the hus­
band is likely to be in no hurry to give up his seraglio' and become
the slave of a housewife, for whom he will have to be assiduous in
the performance of his conjugal duties if he is not to allow his place
to be taken by interlopers, and his wife to present him with children
of dubious parenthood which he will be forced to acknowledge as
his own by the law 'Is pater est quern justae nuptiae demonstrant', that
is 'the true .father is the one designated as such by marriage. ' This law,
the bugbear of every man, permits a white woman to give birth to
a mulatto child even though her husband is white. And that is only
one of the dangers marriage exposes men to. They also see it as a
trap set for them, a plunge that they may have to take. Before they
' The word 'seraglio' only refers to large towns, in which any young man with
some breeding and fortune can assemble a better-assorted seraglio than the Grand
S ultan's. There are three classes of odalisks: well-bred women, petty-bourgeois
women and courtesans; this is the reason why young people in large towns are so
hostile to the bond of marriage, which is much less feared in boring, moral towns
like those in Switzerland.
l l3

The Theory of the Four Movements
take that step they try endless ruses and calculations. There is
nothing more absurd than the tips they give each other on ways to
bend wives to the yoke and bewitch them. There is nothing as odd
as those groups of young men who meet to discuss marriageable
young ladies and the traps set by fathers in their attempt d to get
their daughters off their hands. After lengthy discussion they always
conclude that they must marry money; and that if they are going to
be deceived by their wives, they can at least make sure they are not
tricked out of the dowry, and that they have some indemnity to
compensate for the disadvantages of marriage. This is how men
reason when they are about to be married. This is the attitude with
which they approach the sacred knot and the philosophical delights
of the household. This calculating approach is as far from love as
household life is from good living. Doubtless people live well in the
minority of wealthy households (about one out of every eight), but
the other seven carry on aimlessly, filled with envy at the sight of
the eighth's well-being. All of them in the end, rich or poor, are
completely fed up with themselves and the uniformity of their lives,
and you see them indulging at great expense in anti-household pleas­
ures, like haunting public places, theatres, dances, cafes, etc . , keep­
ing open house if they are rich, or indulging in other sorts of enter­
tainment if they cannot themselves afford the cost of the distraction
they need.
All these pastimes, so expensive in the current order, will be
lavishly and freely available to everybody in the seventh period,
some of whose arrangements I am going to outline. Everybody will
be assured of a regular variety of parties and entertainments, and a
degree of freedom inconceivable to you in your household meals,
governed as they are by constrained manners and a host of pre­
judices very far removed from the relaxed comfort you can already
sometimes find in picnics and intimate suppers. A further point to
note about these household meals, where all the sparkle has been
d

To be frank, fathers of marriageable daughters play an objectionable role in civilis­
ation. I suppose that paternal love is capable of rendering them blind to the dis­
graceful nature of the methods and cajoleries they adopt in order to lure suitors,
but they can hardly be blind to the uneasiness and disquiet that attaches to such
a role. How many of those overburdened with daughters must long for somebody
to discover a new domestic order where marriage will no longer exist, and where
they will be rid of the trouble of finding husbands for them! And what gratitude
they will owe the person who brings them the discovery!

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
taken out by the uneven mix of ages or companions and by the
tiring nature of the preparations, is that even this mediocre form of
entertainment is only possible among the rich. Imagine the fate of
all those couples who are deprived of what people call 'pleasures'
by insufficiency of fortune, and reduced to the domestic war so well
defined by the proverb: 'Fools fight when the cupboard is bare.' And
plenty of wealthy households, anyway, succumb to the disharmony
which is practically universal among the great poverty-embittered
majority.
Admittedly, there are exceptions. Some individuals and some
entire nations submit readily to the yoke of marriage: the patient,
phlegmatic German character, for example, is far better suited to
conjugal servitude than the fickle, restless French. Exceptions like
these are used by apologists of marriage to support their case; but
of course they only cite favourable instances: that kind of binding
relationship probably does suit a man in his declining years, who
wants to be free of the corruption around him. I would be happy
to believe that a wife could find the company of a man like that
attractive, and turn her back on the vortex of fashionable society
for his sake, but why does the male sex only develop such sensible
tastes after fifteen or twenty years of flirtation? And when men with­
draw from society why do they not choose mature, experienced
women like themselves, instead of hoping that some young damsel
will be more precociously virtuous than they have ever been? It is
amusing that civilised man, who boasts of the superiority of his
reason over women's, should require girls of sixteen to behave with
a degree of rationality they do not themselves acquire until they are
thirty or forty and have wallowed in debauchery since their youth.
I f they only attain reason by way of pleasure, they should surely
not be surprised if a woman gets there by the same route.
Their household policy, based on the fidelity of innocent young
girls, is quite outside any of God's designs. The fact that he has
given young women a taste for pleasure and dissipation is one proof
that he does not intend them for marriage or household life, which
would require a taste for retirement. This is also why men are
bound to be unhappy in households, as they marry young women
whom nature has not given any inclination for that sort of life.
The philosophers' contribution to this has been to promise to
change the passions of women, to repress nature. A laughable claim!
IIS

The Theory of the Four Movements
We know how successful that has been. In marriage, as in any other
contract, the men who most deserve happiness are the most likely
to meet with misfortune. The ones who most deserve a settled mar­
riage meet the most treacherous and lascivious women and the hus­
band's loyalty becomes the focus of the deceit practised upon him.
He will be the most easily taken in by the affectation of modesty
and the air of innocence which philosophical education bestows on
all young women to disguise their nature. Despite all the moralists'
systems, happiness is not to be found in our households; a universal
cry is being raised against the tedium of that kind of life, and it is
the men who are complaining about it, the same men who shaped
the law and ought to have benefited from it. What, therefore, would
the women say, if they had the right to complain? What is one to
think of an institution which the stronger sex, who established it,
find wearisome, and which is even more wearisome to the weaker
sex, who are nonetheless prevented from voicing any complaint
about it?
We are expected to admire the apparent harmony of these house­
holds, in which a young victim, with heroic devotion, puts up with
the persecutions of a jealous husband who has retired from society.
But this is surely a worse state of war than the one existing between
some married couples in German villages, where the husband keeps
a stick called domestic peace beside the hearth and uses it as the last
word in any conjugal argument. Oppression may be less visible in
polite society, but it is just as much a reality. Why then do both
sexes not rebel against a domestic order which subjects them to so
much frustration and annoyance? Seeing this domestic war among
citizens of all classes, people ought surely to be able to realise that
the married state is not man's destiny. Instead of looking for palli­
atives for the dissension within couples we should have been looking
for ways of escaping from a household life which breeds and
encourages every sort of discord and tedium without producing any
compensating advantages which could not be found in a state of
complete freedom.
Progressive Household or Nine-group Tribe

Let us turn now to the system which could replace our domestic
state: this is a measure, taken from the seventh social period, which
I I6

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
I shall call the Progressive Household or Nine-group Tribe. It can be
organised into eight or ten groups, but nine is the most suitable
number for a proper balance of the passions.
To set up one of these tribes, one needs a building capable of
lodging about a hundred people of differing fortune, namely eighty
masters of one sex and about twenty domestic servants of both
sexes; the lodgings need to be of different quality so that people
can choose one appropriate to their fortune, and there must also be
a range of public rooms.
Internally the tribe should, as nearly as possible, form nine groups
of nine (but remember these numbers are not rigid requirements,
just approximate indications); at mealtimes, for example, there
should be nine tables, three in each of three dining-rooms, first,
second and third class, and in each room each table should be served
at consecutive times, such as r, 2 and 3 o'clock, avoiding uniformity
in everything. Uniformity, half-heartedness and mediocrity are the
three natural enemies of the passions and harmony, because the
equilibrium of the passions can only be established by a regular
clash of contraries.
The tribe will have three compatible occupations: a tribe of arti­
sans, for instance, could practise the three trades of carpenter, joiner
and cabinet-maker. Each society has to have a name, an escutcheon:
this one might be the Oak Tribe. Nearby might be the Lilac Tribe,
made up of women who work as linen-drapers, tailors and milliners.
Each member contributes to a capital fund at one of three fixed,
graduated rates, such as 4,000, 8,ooo and 1 2,000, or nothing, 1 ,000
and 2,000. Or if some rich people wanted to found a particularly
magnificent tribe, their capital could be as much as r no thousand,
200 thousand and 300 thousand, as long as the principle that the
first class pays three times as much as the third class is observed.
This capital fund serves as a guarantee against the advances for
food, rent and tax which the tribe collectively makes to each of its
members.
The societies do not allow any coercive rules or monastic dis­
comfort, so for example third-class companies or individuals may
sometimes be served food of the second or first class: the tribe's
ruling body can grant this favour to anybody who does not abuse it.
The palaces or manors of neighbouring tribes should be able to
intercommunicate by means of sheltered, covered arcades so that
I I7

The Theory of the Four Movements
people, whether engaged on business matters or pleasure, will be
protected from the severity of the weather which we suffer from
all the time in Civilisation. People must be able to move freely from
one palace to another along heated or ventilated passage-ways, with
none of the current risk of constantly getting soaked through, spat­
tered with mud, and ending up with colds or pneumonia, because
of moving from enclosed rooms to open streets. After a ball or a
banquet, the men and women who are going to sleep away from
their tribes must be able to walk under cover without having to get
dressed up in boots and furs and without the bother of climbing
into a carriage; and instead of going down three or four streets, as
they would have to in Civilisation, they need only pass through the
public arcades of three or four adjacent manors, never feeling heat
or cold, rain or wind. This system of sheltered communications is
just one of the thousand pleasures of the combined order which we
can already get an idea of from the nine-group tribe.
Eighteen tribes altogether, nine masculine and nine feminine,
would need to be set up to ensure balanced competition; but this
would cost more than establishing a combined-order phalanx. The
experiment could therefore be limited to six tribes, three of men
and three of women. Even competition on this reduced scale would
enable the six tribes completely to eradicate three philosophical
vices: uniformity, half-heartedness and mediocrity. For example, if
the Reed Tribe is the poorest of the six it will do its utmost to
excel in cleanness, dexterity, politeness and other qualities compat­
ible with its slender fortune, and what is more it will avoid all
pretension to areas in which it would not be able to rise above
mediocrity.
This kind of association, unlike the combined order, will not
allow extreme contrasts, such as that between a pauper and a
millionaire. Those disparities will be in harmony with the eighth
period, but they are not at all suitable for the seventh, which is the
one we are dealing with here. In the eighth period, association is
based on contrast, whereas in the seventh it is based on differences
of degree: thus although a progressive household, or nine-group
tribe, is composed of members who are not equal, they have to
maintain some similarity among themselves, while an eighth-period
phalanx has to bring together very different sorts of people.

II8

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
An embyronic form of the progressive household can be per­
ceived in our cities, in men 's and women 's clubs or casinos which are
beginning to attract people away from insipid family parties. They
provide inexpensive balls and concerts, and a store of games, news­
papers and other distractions which would cost ten times as much
in private houses. The pleasures they offer save both money and
effort because all the preparations are taken care of by the staff, as
in the progressive household, but there is a general equality in clubs
and casinos which hinders the development of ambition, whereas
the progressive household, with its subdivision into nine unequal,
rival groups, provides enormous scope for the three ambitious
schemes of protector, protege and independent.
I shall not say anything here about the arrangements for children
and their education in these households, as to explain it in detail
would require a complete synopsis of the seventh period. Let us
merely think about the embryonic idea I have proposed, the hypo­
thesis of an establishment composed of six progressive households,
two of which are wealthy, two middle-class and two poor. Let us
imagine these six tribes suddenly placed in Civilisation, in a city
like Paris or London: what would be the results of this domestic
innovation, so foreign to our old habits of incoherence?
Note first that the establishment of these six tribes would not
require the overthrow of empires and the bloodshed which always
accompany attempts to put the visions of philosophers into practice.
The task would be a very peaceable one, and instead of laying waste
the earth in the name of the rights of man, it would involve the
peaceful establishment of the rights of women by allocating them
three of the six proposed establishments with their nine classes of
fortune for each sex.
The results this innovation would produce are enigmas I leave
the curious to imagine, while I try to get them under way.
In administrative economics, it is surely a great advantage for
a ruler to deal with a tribe which pays its taxes after a simple
request, on a fixed day, rather than having to deal with twenty
incoherent families, half of whom defraud the revenue and the
rest of whom only pay up after being harassed by tax-collectors.
There is no need for that kind of procedure with tribes: in the
event of a law being contravened, the only punishment necessary

1 19

The Theory of the Four Movements
is loss of reputation, as in taking down the escutcheon from the
doorway. Think of the increase in the king's revenue and the
ease of administration if the whole kingdom were organised in
tribes of this sort. Even if he reduced taxes by a third he would
still be half as rich again, whether by saving on the cost of
collection or as a result of the increase in taxable production
which would stem from combined industry.
In domestic economics, individual expenses would be similarly
reduced . In progressive households it would be possible to live far
better on an income of 1 ,000 livres than on one of 3 ,000 in incoher­
ent households, as well as doing away with the burdensome need to
buy food, manage the household and carry out all the other tasks
which would instead be carried out by each tribe's group of major­
domos. No men or women who do not enjoy the work of major­
domos or household management would have to do any domestic
work; after their work is finished they would have nothing to do
except enjoy themselves by trying out the different tables and varied
companionship of their tribe and the neighbouring tribes of both
sexes, inviting others back in exchange. Invitations, which involve
us in so much expense, would therefore cost the reciprocal revellers
nothing, as no tribe would profit either from its members, who
would be indemnified for each meal they missed, or from their
guests, whose meals would cost the same as those of the members.
So that, for everything to be balanced, all the members could spend
their time as hosts or guests at feasts which would cost not a penny
more than if they stayed at home alone. As for the meals themselves,
I have already pointed out that combined labour means that they
only cost a third of the effort and expense of meals in incoherent
households.
(To judge the variety and charm that these gatherings of diners
from different tribes would offer, you would have to understand
the amorous and industrial relations of the seventh period, which
would take too long to describe.)
As to morality, one can see that every tribe, however poor, is
governed by an esprit de corps, a jealous guarding of the tribe's
honour, and that the 1 st of the three classes becomes a model for
the other two, who strive to imitate it. This esprit de corps is enough
to banish the worst vices of the civilised population, coarseness,
slovenliness and meanness, and any other failings by which a tribe
1 20

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
would feel itself degraded so that it would instantly expel anybody
guilty of them.
This would all be the result of the struggle between the sexes.
The female tribes would always be doing their best to shine in
civility and to compensate for their lack of fortune by an excess of
courtesy. This spirit is incompatible with the popular organisations
in Civilisation, which lack the three elements that have a refining
influence on the human race, namely:
1.
2.

3.

The struggle between male and female organisations.
Competition between the three classes of a tribe and between the
unequal groups in each class.
The leisure enjoyed by people in the seventh period, in which subordinate jobs are three times as lucrative as in the incoherent order.

Since our organisations are deprived of these three elements it is
not surprising that there is a tendency towards coarseness in all
middle-class and lower-class occupations. Yet we do see some poor
men, like those in the army, with a strong sense of nobility, ready
to sacrifice their lives for the honour of their regiment, despite
deriving no benefit from it. This general enthusism among soldiers
is an indication of the use that could be made of esprit de corps if
it were j oined with compound progress in both sexes, as will happen
in the seventh period, when all the tedious social and domestic
annoyances of Civilisation are a thing of the past.
Among these domestic annoyances must be placed that of per­
sonal service, which will not exist in the seventh period. Domestic
servants in general will not be attached to individuals but to the
tribe, each of them being allocated to various members whose
characters are sympathetic to their own. This right o f choice will
make service a pleasure for both superiors and inferiors, as they
will be brought together by friendship rather than money, an
arrangement as yet unknown in familial societies, where servants
are generally secret enemies of their masters. There are three main
reasons for this:
1.

Poor wages, which are very low in the incoherent order. Because
service is more complicated there it requires three times as
many servants as in a tribe, and their wages are therefore a
third of what they could be in a tribe.
121

The Theory of the Four Movements

3.

The incompatibility of character which renders the superior tyr­
annical and makes mutual relations extremely chilly. This is
exacerbated by the fear of theft and other forms of mistrust
which cannot arise in tribes.
Multiplicity of duties. The necessity for this will not arise in
tribes, where everybody will only carry out those tasks to
which he is temperamentally suited, and can choose only
partially to be involved in domestic work. In the current
order, on the other hand, servants are obliged to see to
twenty duties, half of which they may not like, and con­
sequently blame their masters for the fact that they dislike
their jobs, and indeed often hate their masters before they
even make their acquaintance.

Domestic service in tribes, in short, provides numerous pleasures
for both valets and masters, for this order can take any occupation
which is a source of tedium or annoyance in the civilised order,
and make it enjoyable.
Old people, in particular, would be able to find work in the new
order. There is nothing more distressing than the lot of children
and old people in the civilised order: there are no suitable jobs for
the very old and the very young, with the result that childhood and
old age become a burden on the social body. Children are neverthe­
less cherished for the services they will render in the future, whereas
old people, from whom nothing is expected except a legacy, are
unwelcome, despised, ridiculed behind their backs, and hounded
into the grave. There is still some respect for them in rich families,
but among the peasantry and the mass of the people there is nothing
sadder than the fate of the old. They are degraded, openly rebuffed,
scorned and everywhere made to feel that their lives are useless.
Progressive households put an end to such scandalous behaviour,
as old people have jobs which are j ust as useful as those of men in
the prime of life. As long as they remain healthy they enjoy as
delightful a life as they did when they were young.
It is a telling indication of the wonderful suitability of the pro­
gressive household to the human passions that nature has distrib­
uted different tastes and inclinations in the proportion and variety
appropriate to the new order, and in constant disproportion to the
needs of the civilised order.
1 22

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
There is a proof of this which I have already adduced, but which
is worth reiterating. I have said that the majority of women have
neither inclination nor aptitude for household work, most finding
the care of one small family frustrating and exhausting; a few on
the other hand make light of domestic work, and are so good at it
that they would be capable of running a hundred-person home.
Yet Civilisation requires all women to show an equal taste for the
household work that they all have to do. Why then does nature
refuse to allow three-quarters of them an aptitude for it? In order
to retain the proportion appropriate to the societary order, which
will employ scarcely a quarter of them on these tasks.
Add to this those details which are men's responsibility, and
which may serve to make them aware of the unsuitability of isolated
households. The example I shall take is care of the cellars, from
which nature has excluded women. In the current order this makes
it necessary for every head of household to know about oenology,
knowledge which is not easy to acquire. Three-quarters of rich
households lack this knowledge, and consequently are very poorly
stocked with wine; they spend a lot of money on drink, but have
nothing but adulterated and badly kept wines because they have to
rely on wine-merchants who are the most adept swindlers, and on
hired cellarmen whose only skill is cheating. That is why a meal
with an ordinary citizen who knows about the management of wine
is often preferable to a meal with a prince who has spent vast sums
to serve his guests an assortment of liquid poisons compounded by
wine-merchants, and even by proprietors, who since the develop­
ment of the mercantile spirit have become as corrupt as the
merchants.
There will be no need for a societary tribe to fear this sort of
fraud, as its membership will always include a committee of experi­
enced cellarmen whom it will be impossible to deceive, or even to
surprise. All the tribe's supplies, food, drink or whatever, will be
intelligently chosen and kept in prime condition, without the
majority of the members having to concern themselves with organ­
ising it. All that will be required is a committee of specialists to
look after each area, who will derive pleasure, profit and respect
from so doing.
Continued analysis of the drawbacks of our kind of life, in iso­
lated households, will make it clear that all our domestic difficulties
123

The Theory of the Four Movements
derive from a single cause, from social incoherence and the way it
requires every man and woman to have all sorts of tastes and know­
ledge which nature has only bestowed on a very small number of
us, so as not to exceed the needs of the societary order which is
our destiny and which will normally only employ ten people where
we currently employ a hundred . There would therefore be no point
in nature lavishly distributing inclinations and characteristics which
we regard as praiseworthy, such as that of the housewife, when they
would become useless and superfluous in the societary state if there
were as many of them as the civilised order demands. My argument
from this is the same conclusion as I have articulated several times:
there is nothing vicious in our tastes or our characters, which have
been distributed in the variety and proportion appropriate to our
future destinies; and there is nothing vicious on earth except the
civilised and incoherent order, and its complete inability to adapt
to the system of our passions, which are all designed for the needs
of the societary order, of which the progressive household is the
embryonic form .
Method of the union of the sexes in the seventh
period [but not in the eighth]

In this period, which is so easy to organise, amorous freedom begins
to develop and transforms most of our vices into virtues, just as it
transforms most of our elegant manners into vices. There will be
several grades of amorous union, the three principal ones being:

Favourites and titular favourites.
Natural co-parents.
Husbands and wives.
The last of these must have at least two children together, the
second only one and the first none. These titles give the couples
varying rights of inheritance.
A woman may simultaneously have: first, a husband by whom
she has two children; second, a co-parent by whom she has one
child; third, a favourite who has lived with her and retained the
title; and in addition to these, plain lovers, who have no rights in
law. This gradation of titles gives these commitments a large meas­
ure of urbanity and fidelity. A woman may refuse the title of co1 24

Second part: The pri·vate or domestic destinies
parent to a favourite by whom she is pregnant; in cases of dissatis­
faction she may thus refuse several men the superior title they aspire
to. And men can act similarly in respect of their different women.
This system completely obviates the hypocrisy caused by marriage.
In Civilisation, all rights exist in perpetuity from the moment the
fatal bond is sealed, and everybody has to deal with the full conse­
quences of their hypocrisy. Thus it comes about that most husbands
and wives complain of being trapped within a few days of their
marriage, and remain trapped for life. Such traps no longer exist
in the seventh period; couples only progress through the amorous
stages over time, having at first no title beyond that of favourite,
which carries few rights with it and can be revoked if the parties
are unsuitable. A man who wants a child runs no risk of being
prevented by the sterility of his sole wife. And the wife runs no
risk of being made permanently unhappy by the hypocrisy of a
husband who reveals himself the day after the wedding to be viol­
ent, jealous or a gambler. Conjugal titles are only conferred after
adequate trial has been made, and as they are not exclusive they
never become more than attractions of courtesy, not the means of
persecution which stem from exclusive marriage and the equality
to which it reduces all the ties of love.
This short digression on progressive households is not nearly
enough to provide an adequate sense of the seventh period: among
other things it needs to be supplemented by a note on that society's
amorous code, and its system of education. However I shall not
enlarge upon it: the little I have said about progressive households
is sufficient to demonstrate how very easy it is to escape from the
labyrinth of Civilisation by a purely domestic operation, without
political upheavals or scientific effort.
The abundant advantages revealed by this simple innovation pro­
vide an opportunity for me to stress two absurdities which I have
already pointed out: the stupidity of the philosophers, who have
never suggested any innovations in domestic matters; and the gen­
eral gullibility of the male sex who allow the continuation of con­
jugal servitude, which they are the victims of, and whose only
consolation is the malign pleasure of seeing women more enslaved
and unhappy than they are.
The lowly character of savage and barbarous women ought to
have demonstrated to civilised man that men's happiness in love
1 25

The Theory of the Four Movements
is proportionate to the freedom enjoyed by women. Such free­
dom, by opening the way to pleasures, also opens the way to
the honourable behaviour which is part of their attraction. How
hypocritical your gallantry is ! Young men oiling their way into
households and degrading themselves by cajoleries which extend
from the husband to the lapdog, and for what? To enjoy the
favours of a wife who has just left the arms of her husband, and
to plant the offspring of alien stock in the family. I admit that
love makes many sorts of trickery appear seductive, but looked
at objectively it is an odious role to play. It is scarcely surprising
that civilised love affairs end up in icy indifference, when satiety
reveals the true state of things to the lovers. I have already
mentioned the most glaring aspect of your love affairs, cuckoldry,
which, if we examine it closely, probably makes the performer
look as ridiculous as the wronged party.
Let me explain what I mean: my claim is that the public and the
cuckold himself can amuse themselves at the seducer's expense, and
that cuckoldry often brings more ridicule to the lover than to the
husband.
To demonstrate this, let us first establish a hierarchy of cuckoldry
and introduce into this serious debate the beacon of analytic
method, which the philosophers regard as the path to truth.
Among cuckolds, it is possible to distinguish nine degrees of
cuckoldry, both among men and women, for women are cuckolded
far more often than men; indeed if the husband has horns as tall as
a stag's antlers, the wife's may be said to be as high as the branches
of a tree.
I shall merely give the three basic varieties here, namely the
common cuckold, the short-horned cuckold and the long-horned
cuckold.'
I.

The common cuckold i s a respectable, jealous husband who is
unaware of his misfortune and believes himself to be the sole
possessor of his wife. As long as other people sustain his
illusion by exercising laudable discretion, there is no reason to

' [ 'The full list comprises 64 species, progressively arranged by class, order and
kind, from the budding cuckold to the posthumous cuckold. I have limited myself to
describing three species, as I have wanted in this as in other matters to take sound­
ings about what matters to develop more fully in the Treatise.']

make fun of him: he cannot after all be angry at an offence he
has no knowledge of. Any ridicule attaches to the seducer, who
ingratiates himself and bows and scrapes to the man with whom
he knowingly shares the woman.
The short-horned cuckold is a husband, sated with love in his
own household, who wants to take his pleasures elsewhere and
turns a blind eye to his wife's conduct, abandoning her to her
lovers, with the sole reservation that he will not acknowledge
any child of hers. Such husbands are not figures of mockery;
quite the reverse, they have the right to gossip about other
people's horns as boldly as if they had none themselves.
The long-horned cuckold i s a n absurdly j ealous husband, quite
unsuited to his wife, and well aware of her infidelity, a maniac
who wants to kick against the decree of destiny, but whose
clumsy attempts to resist it make him an object of derision for
his useless precautions, his rage and his uncontrolled outbursts.
Moliere's Georges Dandin is the perfect example of a long­
horned cuckold.

Let us look at the ordinary common cuckold, the first variety.
If honour in love consists in exclusive possession, it is clear
that the common cuckold saves his honour, while his supplanter
knowingly allows his honour to be harmed. He humiliates himself
so far as to hear without murmur the threats directed towards
him, because the husband openly reveals his intention of hunting
down anybody who tries to seduce his wife. He is degraded by
his diplomacy with the husband, and again by his deception with
the wife, who continually tells him that her husband no longer
cohabits with her. He pretends to believe this to preserve his
self-respect, yet can he really be unaware that a woman in this
situation redoubles her enthusiasm for her husband in order to
hide her intrigue and prevent his suspicions in the event of her
becoming pregnant? This consideration alone forces the woman
to seek her husband's favours at the very time she wants to yield
to the gallant, because she is afraid that he may be careless; so,
out of prudence, she gives herself to her lover only after protect­
ing herself with her husband's favours: a very flattering pre­
caution for her suitor! A wonderful position to find himself in!
These incontestable facts make every fop wince when they are
1 27

The Theory of the Four Movements
explained to him, and he becomes very disconcerted with the
trophies he thought he had won from the husband, and convinced
that his honour is by no means undamaged.
And even if the husband is an indulgent man, and the lover is
able to take his place, does he not realise that this Argus can return
to his duties and demand his wife's favours whenever he likes? What
kind of victory is it to possess a woman who lives with a master
who can enjoy her at will, in a relationship sanctioned by civil and
religious authority? For according to Sanchez and other casuists,
any spouse who refuses to perfurm his or her marital duty is guilty
of mortal sin. (By this decision the Church at least grants equal
rights to women, as it condemns both men and women for refusing
conjugal rights. This judgement is absent from the work of the
philosophers, who are not concerned if women are scorned, and do
not allow them the right to demand the daily bread which is a
household obligation. )
A survey of these feats of cuckoldry reveals nothing but degrad­
ing situations for the beaux, who take pride in what they do when
most of them in reality are merely objects of shame whose only
talent is to deceive husbands when they are off their guard, a talent
which seems pretty wretched to anyone acquainted with a freer
and more honourable conduct of love affairs than happens in
Civilisation.
I have said enough to prove that civilised man views everything
in the wrong way, as is borne out by these intrigues of cuckoldry
they pride themselves on, but which are completely unpleasing to
men of refinement. One can see from this how far civilised man is
subject to error on important matters when he is so wrong on simple
ones such as cuckoldry. Our opinions on this subject are so far
removed from reason because we try to ignore the meanness and
coarseness of the pleasures that Civilisation offers us. You would
have a very low opinion of your love affairs if I gave you a descrip­
tion of the way in which love is organised in the seventh period,
in the tribes or progressive households which, as embryonic forms of
the combined order, already have its capacity to eradicate the acci­
dental maladies which introduce so many obstacles into even the
freest of civilised love affairs.
Self-interest, pleasure and equity brought about the simple
invention of progressive households. The only reason such an obvious
128

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
process remained unrecognised for so long is the human race's fatal
habit of leaving all social improvement to the philosophers, whose
sole exertions in that area are to upset administrative affairs in order
to intervene in them themselves, and who only interest themselves
in the domestic order to tighten the chains of the weaker sex. Most
of them are past the age at which they are attractive to women and
their one aim is to repress and misuse a servile housewife . Entirely
occupied with moulding young women by their canting insin­
uations, they bend all their writings to this purpose, preaching the
oppression of women and boasting about the pleasure of burying
them alive as ornaments for a libertine's withdrawal from society.
They come together to deprive young people of the liberty they
have made so much use of, belonging to the class of jealous husband
described by Horace as the old age which
Incapable of the pleasures he misused in youth
Blames in her a happiness which age denies to him.

Rousseau, for example, rants about keeping women in the house­
hold, at the same time as he admits that he was an ardent enthusiast
for prostitutes and compliant beauties, descending to the most
indiscreet details about the shapely form of the women who were
so generous to him. How would he have procured his diversions if
all the women had followed his pretexts and lived only for a hus­
band? This is what the philosophers are like; they rant against
riches, honour and pleasure and immerse themselves in them with­
out restraint, under the pretext of reforming and improving the
world. Steeped as they are in their selfishness, are they incapable
of welcoming any idea, or shaping any plan, which is favourable to
women? Could they fall in on any matter with God's designs, which
conduce to justice, that is, to the good of the weaker sex as well as
that of the stronger?
Degradation of women in Civilisation

Is there a shadow of j ustice to be seen in the fate which has befallen
them! Is a young woman not a piece of merchandise offered for
sale to whoever wants to negotiate her acquisition and exclusive
ownership? Is not the consent she gives to the marriage bond deris­
ory and enforced upon her by the tyranny of all the prejudices
1 29

The Theory of the Four Movements
which have beset her since childhood? People try to persuade her
that her chains are merely garlands of flowers: but can she really
be under any illusion about her degradation, even in regions bloated
with philosophy like England, where a man has the right to lead
his wife to market with a rope around her neck and sell her, like a
beast of burden, to anybody who can pay his price? Our public
opinion on this point can hardly claim to be more advanced than
in those crude times when the Council of Macon, a true council of
vandals, deliberated the question of whether women had souls, and
decided in the affirmative by a majority of only three votes. English
legislation, so praised by the moralists, accords men several rights
which are equally dishonourable to the sex, such as the husband's
right to demand financial compensation from his wife's acknowl­
edged lover. The form this slavery takes in France is less crude,
but it is basically the same. Here, as everywhere else, we see young
women languishing, falling ill and dying for want of a union which
nature imperiously commands and which prejudice forbids, on pain
of being branded immoral, before they have been legally sold. How­
ever uncommon such events may be, they happen frequently
enough to attest to the enslavement of the weaker sex, a contempt
for nature's wishes and the absence of all j ustice where women are
concerned.
Among the indications promising a fortunate outcome for the
extension of female privileges, we must consider the experience of
all countries. We have already noted that the best countries have
always been those which allowed women the most freedom: we have
seen this with savages and barbarians as well as in Civilisation. The
Japanese, who are the bravest, the most industrious and the most
honourable of the barbarians are also the least jealous and the most
indulgent towards women, so much so that the grotesque Chinese
make the voyage to Japan to find the love which their hypocritical
customs forbid. The Tahitians, for the same reason, are the best of
the savages. No other horde has developed industry to such an
extent, given the slender resources their country provides. The
French, who persecute women the least, are also the best of the
civilised nations, in that they are most flexible, so that a skilful
sovereign can draw the best part of them into any work in very
little time; and despite some faults, like frivolity, individual pre-

1 30

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
sumptiori and slovenliness, they are the principal civilised nation
just by virtue of their flexibility, which is the character furthest
removed from barbarians. It can similarly be observed that the most
corrupt nations have always been those in which women were most
subjugated, as witness the Chinese, the dregs of the globe, who are
the most deceitful, most cowardly and most pleasure-starved of all
industrial peoples, and who are also the most jealous and intolerant
in matters of love. Of the modern, civilised countries, the least gen­
erous towards women are the Spanish, and thus they have remained
more backward than other European nations, and are renowned
neither in the arts nor the sciences. As for the savage hordes, a
study of them would show that there too the most corrupt are those
who have the least regard for the weaker sex, and among whom the
condition of women is the most wretched.
f

The charge of presumption is applicable only to individuals, not to the French
nation; the nation, collectively, falls victim to the opposite vice, self-distrust, believ­
ing itself incapable of carrying out anything on its own. The phrase it 's impossible
is constantly on French people's lips, and one might call the French a Nation of
impossibles. The only things they respect and admire are foreigners: an artist or
scholar is worth twice as much in France if he is a foreigner. No other nation
enjoys tormenting its great men so much, during their lifetime: France is a scholar's
hell. It is quite different in other countries, which deify everybody they produce.
In Germany every writer is regarded as a great man during his lifetime, and they
lavish the epithet famous on them at the slightest sign of success. While the French
nation, far from being presumptuous, sets about applauding and imitating the vices
of foreigners; which is why, for example, in 1787 we saw the old court attempting
to introduce the noble custom of beating into military discipline, in imitation of
the Prussians with whom they were infatuated. And oh! what absurd fashions they
borrowed from the English, whom they were similarly obsessed with. The French
in fact are very modest, even in war, where their numerous successes ought to
inspire some presumption. Proof of this was to be seen in the most recent campaign
where the Prussians gave vent to the most indecent bragging: from the diatribes

printed in Berlin it seemed that one appearance, one breath of the Prussian legions
was going to annihilate the French army which was advancing without any such
boastfulness, and with no rhodomontade from the French press. These character­
istics are sufficient proof that the French nation is not suffering from presumption
but from the opposite characteristic, lack of confidence in itself and an admiration
of foreigners. No people is more hospitable and more honourable in its treatment
of conquered enemies. Yet individually the French are presumptuous, and they
flaunt this vice in their affected manners and their conceited bearing, and in their
habitual punning and joking. So what is the source of this contrast between the
characteristic presumption of individuals and the modest, flexible character of the
nation? I could explain the cause and the remedy, but it is not always a good thing
to tell the full truth.

131

The Theory of the Four Movements
As a general proposition: Social progress and changes of historical
period are brought about as a result of the progress of women towards
liberty; and the decline of social orders is brought about as a result of
the diminution of the liberty of women.
Other events influence these political vicissitudes, but there is no
other cause which produces such rapid social progress or decline
as a change in the condition of women. I have already said that the
mere adoption of closed harems would soon return us to the period
of barbarism, and the act of opening the harems would be sufficient
to transform barbarism into Civilisation. To sum up, the extension
of the privileges of women is the basic principle of all social progress.

Correctives which would have led into the sixth
period

Amorous majority, amorous corporations: their results
Amorous majority
It is our globe's great misfortune that among the sovereigns of Civil­
isation there has never been a single friend to women, no prince
who has treated women justly. Some have demonstrated gallantry,
but there is a great difference between that and the impartiality of
which I am about to give two illustrations. These might seem like
seeds of disorder until their influence is understood.
The first step towards impartiality in the treatment of women
would be to grant them an age of amorous majority; to free them at
a certain age from the humiliation of being offered for sale, and of
being obliged to deprive themselves of men's company until some
unknown man haggles over them and marries them. In my opinion,
women ought to be declared emancipated or free at the age of eight­
een, subject to appropriate rules governing the conduct of their love
affairs.
At the age of eighteen a woman has been fully mature for four
years, long enough, I think, for the men of the town or canton to
have had time to think and to choose whether to take her or leave
her.
Given that men, following the law of the strongest, would prefer
all girls to be denied sexual pleasure, in order to reserve their vir132

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
ginity for the first boor who comes and bargains for her, ought one
not to allocate some condition to those who finally do not have a
taker? Should they not, after a few years, be put into circulation,
authorised to provide for themselves as they like, legally to take
lovers, and to do so without requiring permission? Those who have not
found a husband in four years of exposure at balls and outings, high
masses and sermons, run a great risk of never finding one; the
motives which have kept husbands away during the four years' trial
will continue the same after that. And besides, if marriage is useful
in Civilisation, it is proper that men should be stimulated to it by
the fear of losing the youthful first-fruits of the women they leave
untouched after their eighteenth birthday.
It would be all the more sensible to take the part of girls who are
neglected because they are usually the most beautiful and the most
likely to have fine children. Very many beautiful women remain
unattached because their beauty frightens men, who are scared of
being cuckolded and turn marriage into a calculus of reason, jeal­
ousy and avarice. This conjugal Machiavellianism ignores the most
distinguished women, the ones most capable of managing a house­
hold. There is nothing more revolting than seeing the way these
unfortunate girls are despised because they do not have money in
their favour. Why on earth have their parents, who have got them
on their hands, not decided to propose some reform of customs so
prejudicious to the less wealthy families, as they are the most
numerous and the ones most in need of protection?
Following these suggestions, women in Civilisation would be div­
ided into two classes: maidens below the age of eighteen, and emanci­
pated women over the age of eighteen. At that age they would acquire
the right to take lovers, subject to laws which would have to be
passed about the fate of children born to such unions. (I shall
describe these laws when I deal with the sixth period, as this is a
sixth-period measure. )
Public opinion and justice would unite t o demand this measure.
Everybody knows that young women who reach the age of twenty
without marrying are ridiculed by men. Their neglect arouses
mockery, they become the butt of gibes and sarcasm, and are forced
into breaking the law by taking secret lovers. Men are such scandal­
mongers, so unjust where women are concerned, that they make
fun of all of them, whether they are virtuous or whether they have
1 33

The Theory of the Four Movements
lost their virginity, at an age when the burden of it becomes too
much to bear.
What would have been the danger of granting amorous liberty to
women over the age of eighteen, and what benefits have we derived
from the oppressive system of the philosophers? All they have done,
with their canting system of education, which makes young ladies
pretend not to care about love, is to organise universal cuckoldry.
After that, no other system more in line with the intentions of
nature could very well produce more cuckolds than we see today.
And would it not be better, given that, to try an order which would
be less oppressive and less degrading to women? Of course it would,
because amorous liberty develops valuable qualities in the classes
who most enjoy it, women ofquality, high-class courtesans, and unmar­
ried women of the petty bourgeoisie.
It is in these three classes of women that the most successful
developments are to be seen: taken together, their qualities add up
to perfection. To wit:
Ladies ofthe court. By this I mean those who are amorous, natural,
relaxed, with an exuberant manner which inspires friendship.
Anyone seeing them for the first time is instantly seduced by them;
he thinks he has found women who transcend ordinary human
nature because they are so different from bourgeois women, to
whom lying comes automatically, who have narrow souls where love
reigns exclusively and allows no other passion access, and who have
an icy disregard for friendship, or fondness for the arts and other
noble qualities. The ladies of the court no doubt have their faults
too, but their intrigues are coloured by their naturalness and magna­
nimity. And can one blame them for beautifying vice when it is
what governs Civilisation?
High-class courtesans, leaving aside a degree of stratagem which
their kind of trade demands, are full of noble qualities; they are
obliging, charitable and warm-hearted; their character would be
sublime if their income was large enough, witness that of Ninon.
Being used to pleasure they have none of the slyness and the ulterior
sensuality so noticeable in bourgeois women steeped in morality, in
those housewives whose displays of sentiment constantly reveal a
sensuality which they insist on denying although it never mars a
woman when it is in balance with the affections of her soul, as it is
with women who are openly amorous .
1 34

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
Petty-bourgeois women, shop-girls, workers etc. are, until they
marry, a class of women who are entirely free, especially in cities.
They parade their lovers under the nose of their mother and father,
and change them whenever they like. In short, they enjoy in pro­
fusion what is denied to young ladies of higher rank.g They spend
their youth flitting from man to man, with the result that they are
better at work and cleverer at finding some innocent to marry them
when they are past their prime. Doubtless one may criticise their
mania for perpetual dissimulation, but the blame for this must be
laid on the bad conduct of the middle-class men around them. By
and large they have pleasant dispositions; above all, they are excel­
lent housewives, greatly preferable to the fine ladies of higher rank.
To sum up: the female character would be raised to perfection if
the qualities of the three classes of women I have described could
be united; and such would indeed be the effect of a social order in
which the female sex enjoyed full amorous liberty. By trying to
achieve the single aim of housewife you lose everything by wanting
too little. Your young women, stuffed with prejudices and philo­
sophy, are denatured creatures, consumed with desires, their minds
continually distracted; they work without pleasure, have only a
superficial knowledge of the skills they are taught, forget everything
they have learned when they get married, and soon become bad
housewives unless their husband is clever enough to show them
what to do. Society dazzles them and they are all the more easily
seduced by it because it is new to them; whereas women who have
had some experience before their marriage will be less infatuated
with pleasure and, being aware of the wiles of men, will be more
attached to the household and their husbands, whom they will
regard as protectors against the importunity of other men. If they
do take substitutes it will be for relaxation rather than passion; their
affairs will not make them forget the interests of their household,
and they will do all they can to mitigate the inevitable disgrace of
cuckoldry. Such women are eminently suited to easy-going men,
' So-called well-bred young ladies have to put up with a deplorable and bizarre form
of persecution, as they see petty-bourgeois women in their town, in their houses,
or beneath their windows, enjoying themselves and indulging in love affairs while
they are forbidden to do so. Why are there such different customs in civilisation,
and what reasons will the philosophers adduce to prove the impossibility of trying
to generalise this amorous liberty, which produces nothing but beneficial effects
in the classes of women who enjoy it?
1 35

compliant husbands who need a domineering wife, a virago, who
can manage the household and wear the trousers. Wives like this
can make weak men happy, providing them with true conjugal love
which consists in common interests and a coalition against the
treachery of society.
And there are so many other classes of men who cannot put up
with these prejudice-ridden women, these philosophic automata
with their impenetrably enigmatic characters, whose simulated art­
lessness arouses distrust even in the philosophers themselves. They
are more aware than anybody how unreliable is that air of simplicity
which education gives young ladies. Every woman who behaves
licentiously seemed as artless as the next one, before her marriage.
The veneer of chastity is a mask which does not deceive men, does
not hasten marriage and has no other purpose but to encourage
women to dissemble. We know that a whisper of love will create
passions in them and develop a still unknown character, the good­
ness or malignity of which is an unfathomable mystery even to
experienced men. In short, this nonsense of a philosophical edu­
cation is just a vicious circle, like all civilised customs, and ends by
bringing down on men the very disgrace they sought to avoid. What
bewilders the philosophers is the realisation that whatever they do
results in the cuckoldry they are so afraid of. So they continually
change their educational methods, with the sole result that they
disguise girls' desires, but do not change them.
Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret. 1

They become alarmed i f women are brought u p t o understand the
arts or sciences because they do not want these young people to be
interested in anything except looking after the house. They say as
much quite explicitly, even in plays. Their only interest is in gain­
saying love of pleasure; they foresee nothing but a future of cuck­
oldry, they are cantankerous and interfering about women's tastes,
and they are as touchy as eunuchs in a harem.
And when one does manage to sort out their educational
methods, which change from day to day (because new moral treat­
ises appear every day, none of which agrees with the preceding

Horace, Epistles 1, x, 24 ('You may drive out nature with a pitchfork, but it will
always hasten back').

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
ones), what benefit can girls draw from them? Do those who are
loaded with moral precepts [rather than money] find husbands? No,
they are left alone with their virtues. There are only two levers
which bring about marriages in Civilisation: fortune and intrigue.
Fathers know this, which is why they are more concerned to give
their daughters dowries than to educate them. As for intrigue,
fathers do not excel at this, and despite their attempts to coax men
into marriage, they can be outwitted by any girl with the slightest
sophistication who can manage the affair herself, using other wea­
pons apart from virtue. Experienced young women know how to
tell the more modest ones about good catches, and to make good
marriages, without anybody's help, whereas finding a match for an
Agnes, for a nicely brought up young lady, requires a scandalous
amount of mediation by godparents, relatives, lawyers and philo­
sophers who set about some young man, remonstrating and driving
him into the trap, just as butchers and their dogs surround a reluc­
tant ox and drive it into the slaughter-house.
Thus arc marriages contrived. Men only get caught if they are
surrounded by traps and harassed by lawyers and moralists. They
would not be so stubborn if marriage was really a guarantee of
happiness, as it is for those who marry a rich wife.
How is it that a century so given to experiments of all kinds, a
century which has had the courage to topple thrones and altars, has
bent the knee so slavishly to prejudices about love, when these are
the only ones there would have been some benefit in attacking? And
why has nobody thought to try out any of the much-abused plans
for liberty in this area? There was every reason to see what effect
it would have on love, because the happiness of men is proportion­
ate to the freedom enjoyed by women. Imagine that some way was
discovered of reducing all women, without exception, to the chastity
demanded of them, such that no women could make love before
marriage, nor have any man after her marriage except her husband,
with the result that, for the whole of his life, no man could have
any woman except the housewife he had married. What would men
think about the prospect of being reduced, for their entire lifetime,
to enjoying nobody save a wife whom they had stopped liking the
day after their wedding? Every single man would want to strangle
the originator of a discovery that threatened to abolish love affairs,
and the most ardent opponents of such an order would be the
1 37

The Theory of the Four Movements
philosophers, who are deeply committed to seduction and adultery.
We can therefore see that all men, in their own lives, are at odds
with their maxims about chastity, and that the happiness of the
male sex is proportionate to wives' resistance to the precepts of
conjugal fidelity. Their rigorous observance would drive all men
individually to despair, including the philosophers who, being the
most given to seduction, would be most discomfited by the triumph
of their maxims about love, as they were in 1 789 when their admin­
istrative systems were put to the test.
A further conclusion to be drawn from this discussion is that
civilised man is entirely ignorant about the use of passions in the
moral system, for if the modification I have proposed in regard to
women were adopted, namely the distinction between amorous min­
ority and majority, several extremely advantageous results would
follow, which would greatly benefit civilised morality. Among other
abuses which would be ended is Amorous Confusion, which is one
of the sixteen characteristics of Civilisation. I shall set it beside the
amorous corporations: these have a six-period character, the details
of which everybody will appreciate as it is the closest period to
our own, some of whose domestic customs, such as the incoherent
household, it retains.
Amorous corporations
This heading designates our current habit of admitting no grad­
ations of vice or virtue in love affairs; in the case of adultery, for
example, all conjugal infidelity is equally blameworthy in the eyes
of the philosophers, and they call down the wrath of heaven and
earth on a woman for the slightest fault. Yet there are degrees of
offence in adultery as in everything else: relations with a sterile
woman, or with a woman who is already pregnant, indeed any copul­
ation which does not result in pregnancy, is no more than a pecca­
dillo, especially when the adultery is conditional, tacitly tolerated
by the husband. We must therefore distinguish these various minor
offences from truly culpable adultery, such as causes the break-up
of households or results in heterogeneous offspring. By refusing to
admit these distinctions, by trying to confound and condemn all
kinds of adultery as the same, they render them all excusable and
treat them all with the leniency which only some deserve. Rebellious
opinion has attacked the persecutors with ridicule, and odious acts

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
of treachery have been excused and encouraged under the name of
cuckoldry because the law confuses them with much lesser offences.
They have thus failed in their purpose through an excess of injust­
ice and oppression, and instead have brought about the triumph of
deceit and corruption in love. Because the philosophers regard all
extra-marital pleasure as a crime, it becomes necessary to deny
everything and indulge in endless deceit, which is why all wives
and daughters pretend to be models of fidelity or chastity: but if
there were only admitted to be gradations of virtue and vice in
affairs of the heart we would see the birth of a morality as loyal and
favourable to truth as to pleasure.
If the distinction between amorous majority and minority were
admitted, emancipated women over the age of eighteen would be
classed into three main bodies, namely:
1 st:

Wives, who only have one man in perpetuity, as in
Civilisation.
2nd : Damsels or demi-Ladies, who can change lovers provided they
take them in succession, one at a time, and that the separation
is mutually agreed.
3rd: Ga/antes, whose rules are even less strict.
Each of these three classes is subdivided into three types or grad­
ations, defined in lists of names in each town or canton. Any woman
may change corporation at will.
This order of things (whose subsidiary arrangements would take
too long to describe) would bring into being most of the reforms of
amorous life that are attempted in vain today. It would, for example,
prevent girls from being seduced and abandoned. The reason we
see so many women vegetating all their lives as they wait for a hus­
band, or else giving way to debauchery, is because men can mistreat
the women they court by constant delays, and the women can see no
end to their desolate celibacy. If the end was fixed at eighteen, though,
a seducer would have no chance to misuse a young woman: if she gave
in to him she would be ignominiously suspected or rejected by the
body of maidens; and she is further sustained by the knowledge that
she has only to wait until she is eighteen, at which point her suitors
will be obliged to speak, and if they do not, the maiden will join the
body of Damsels, so as not to waste her youth and beauty. Having
acquired the right to take a lover, she certainly will not choose anyone
1 39

The Theory of the Four Movements
who might have tried to entice her with offers of marriage: that is a
trick young women do not forgive.
Adultery and cuckoldry would thus hardly exist any more. A
seducer would have little success with married women, because they
would risk being suspected even if there were no material proof,
and classified in the lists as questionable or, if the offence was estab­
lished, entered on the list of unfaithful women. The wives would
be watched by the bodies of Damsels and Galantes, and would thus
not dare to tie the conjugal knot unless they had a definite liking
for fidelity. Consequently people would only marry very late, at an
age when their passions were calmer, and marriage would regain its
true purpose, which is the support of old age; marriage is a with­
drawal from society, a rational bond, designed for old people, not
for youth.
The prejudice which ridicules men for marrying girls already
possessed by somebody else would therefore disappear. The Dam­
sels would be in no way degraded by having had lovers because
they would have waited until they were eighteen, as the law
demands, before taking them. Men would marry them with no more
qualms than they now have about marrying a widow with children.
If there is some indignity attached to being the second to possess a
woman in marriage, why are men so eager to marry rich widows
and take on the burden of educating children who are not their
own, and who may indeed have different fathers, if the widow has
been galante? None of these considerations is deemed important,
yet men feel compromised if they marry a girl who has merely been
sexually active without having children. It would seem from this
that our ideas about women's virtue and honour are simply prejud­
ices which vary according to the legislation in force. All that is
needed is a law that reunites nature and public opinion and treats
sexual behaviour as a decent pleasure instead of absurdly declaring
it a vice in women and regarding it as a gracious accomplishment
in men. Men will then only be able to attain to such gentility to the
extent that women want to give themselves up to vice: an amusing
contradiction, but no more amusing than our civilised customs and
opinions! h
' Adultery is declared a crime and yet in the best society a man's reputation is
proportionate to the number of his acknowledged and publicised adulteries. People
admire a Richelieu or an Alcibiades who procured an infinity of married women:

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
The selfishness and the spirit of servility which the married state
engenders will thus be weakened. The principal victim of marriage
is the character of women: they take on all their husband's vices
without adopting any of his good qualities as a necessary conse­
quence of the pliability they become imbued with. Marry a young
Agnes to Robespierre and in a month she will be as fierce as he
and applaud all his crimes. This inclination to servility in wives
would be corrected by competition with the Damsels, whose domi­
nant idea would be not to identify with any man's character as
they could exchange him, but instead to affect a noble, independent
character and remain completely detached from all the vices
inherent in the conjugal state, including selfishness, which marriage
but what opinion do they have of a man who wishes to obey the law and the
commandments of religion and keeps his virginity as a wedding gift for his wife?
He becomes an object of universal ridicule. In the case of adultery, as of duelling,
the law is neutralised by public opinion, which only favours deceit, even shameless
profligacy, in matters of love. A poor girl who lets herself get pregnant without
the municipality's permission is branded with shame and declared blameworthy,
even though she may have been faithful to her lover; but compare her conduct
with that of decent, well-bred women. Yet what is a decent woman in France? A
lady who commonly has three men at once, namely her husband, her titulary lover
and some former holder of that right who returns from time to time to exercise
it, under the guise of a family friend; all without counting occasional brief liaisons.
While leading this sort of life, she is perfectly entitled to be regarded as decent
and well-bred. This is not to be taken as censure of ladies who enjoy themselves,
as they will never have as many lovers as their husbands have mistresses, both
before and after marriage.
If the injustices of public opinion are absurd, its contradictions arc even more
so, as witness the situation of girls who become pregnant: their pregnancy is a
crime, and so is voluntary abortion; yet if they are concerned about their honour,
they must look for ways of keeping it by removing the sign of their weakness.
There is absolutely nothing blameworthy about girls having abortions at the begin­
ning of their pregnancy, before the foetus is alive: it is public opinion that is absurd
in declaring honour to be lost by the entirely innocent act of making a child.
Sweden's customs are much more sensible on this point than those in the rest of
Europe: they do not regard a pregnant girl as dishonoured and indeed forbid
masters to dismiss domestic servants for becoming pregnant when they have com­
mitted no other offence. A very wise custom for a country which needs to increase
its population.
But what is the point of dwelling on the absurdity of our opinions? Nobody
has been a better judge of them than their own propagandists who, seeing no way
of reconciling civilisation and reason, have adopted the charlatan tactic of vastly
inflating the effectiveness of their nostrum, civilisation. However much one dis­
counts the merit of that medicament, it is still to accord it too much value, as it
has none at all. That is what the philosophers' claims add up to when they dreamed
up the idea of telling us that civilised society was the perfect result of the perfection
of perfectibility.

The Theory of the Four Movements
elevates to the highest degree, so that married couples become
extraordinarily distrustful of others like them. There is nothing
harder than to bring two couples together and to get them to live
in the same household. This incompatibility extends from the mas­
ters to the servants, and every household is extremely reluctant to
take on a married couple as domestic staff. They are aware that the
conjugal spirit unites the couple in a league against everybody
around them and stifles noble passions and liberal ideas. Thus the
class of married people is always the most guileful and the most
indifferent to public or private misfortune; and its antisocial nature
is so well known that it is thought to be great praise to say of a man
that marriage has not changed him, and that he still has the pleasant
character of a boy.
Thus we would see the reputations of vice and virtue reduced to
their true worth. I have observed that our customs make no allow­
ances for gradations of vice: all women are obliged to pretend that
they are virtuous, a claim which always favours the most licentious
ladies because they minimise the number of lovers they have had .
How many decent women does one come across who have enjoyed
twenty or more men and who, by their artful confidences, give the
impression that they have only had half a dozen! Whereas some
poor woman who has had no more than two or three is defamed
more than those who have outfaced criticism. This confused state
of affairs would be removed by the division of women into the
various corporations, sorted into different characters. I repeat that
the three amorous sisterhoods I have described would be subdivided
into nine subsidiary types, and j ust as there would be three lists of
Constant Wives, Questionable Wives and Unfaithful Wives, so there
would also be three lists of Damsels and three lists of Ga/antes. This
system would concur with the order of passionate Series which I
have defined in Note A, and as two transitional groups need to be
placed at the ends of each Series, those groups would be the maidens
and a group of independent women, with the former taking no part
in sensual love and the latter observing no rules at all in the exercise
of that passion.
Such an order is the least of the regulatory developments that
could be given to amorous relations; any system which restricts the
passions more than that cannot avoid falling into the vices of equal-

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
ity and philosophical confusion, the odious results of which we see
today.
Vices of the system which oppresses love

It is noteworthy that in the current disorder of amorous customs
women have obtained the only privilege which ought to be denied
them, that of making the husband accept a child which is not his,
and on whose features nature has inscribed the name of the true
father. So in the one case where the wife is culpable she enjoys the
full protection of the law, and in the one case where the man has a
genuine right to be outraged, public opinion and the law concur in
aggravating the insult. Oh! how can civilised men, so persecutory
when it comes to their wives' pleasures, agree so meekly to bow
their heads beneath the yoke, to shelter the fruit of obvious adultery,
to share with it their name and possessions, when they ought to
send it to a foundlings' home? Here indeed we see the fulfilment of
philosophy's design, for it is truly in marriage that men form a
family of brothers, where possessions are common to neighbours'
children as to our own. The generosity of these decent civilised
husbands will be an endless source of mirth in the future, and we
shall need some entertaining pages such as these to help make read­
ing our annals bearable when they have so often been written in
letters of blood.
The way husbands tolerate this most culpable offence is part and
parcel of the general inconsistency that reigns in amorous matters.
It is an area in which we find religion and the theatre publicly
preaching a contradictory morality; next door to a temple where
they teach a horror of amorous intrigue and sensual pleasures we
see a circus, where the audience only goes to practise stratagems of
seduction and to look for sensual pleasure. The young woman who
goes to hear a sermon on the respect she owes her husband and
her superiors will go an hour later to the theatre to take lessons in
the art of deceiving a husband, a tutor or some other Argus; and
God knows which of the two lessons bears the more fruit. These
scandalous contradictions are repeated throughout the civilised
mechanism; and when one looks at such bizarre behaviour with
detachment, one must surely think that the whole of Civilisation is

1 43

The Theory of the Four Movements
a society of madmen, all the more mad since they are aware of the
principle of social improvement and refuse to make use of it. They
know that we only advanced from barbarism to Civilisation by
alleviating the servitude of women: this experimental idea induced
them to extend female privileges, which should have resulted in
passage to the sixth period, then to the seventh, through the com­
plete freedom of women. We can see from this that the path of
social progress was known and easy, and that we would have passed
down it the moment they wanted to move away from the philo­
sophic system which oppressed women. Do not the philosophers
themselves realise that perpetual fidelity in love is contrary to
human nature? And that even if a few simple-minded members of
both sexes can be persuaded to adopt that morality, the mass of
men and women will never be reduced to it? And that any legis­
lation which requires behaviour so incompatible with the passions
can only produce theoretical absurdity and practical chaos, since
the whole body of society will be tacitly in league to condone infrac­
tions of it? Is this not the consequence of the amorous system which
has been dominant for the last 2,500 years? It is simply a continu­
ation of the oppressive customs that reigned in the dark ages, cus­
toms which it is ridiculous to demand in a century which prides
itself on reason and respect for the designs of nature.
There is nothing surprising about the fact that the ancient philo­
sophers of Greece and Rome disregarded the interests of women
since those rhetoricians were all enthusiastic advocates of pederasty,
which was held in high esteem in fashionable antiquity. They
heaped ridicule on anyone who consorted with women, a passion
they regarded as dishonourable. The code of Lycurgus incited
young men to sodomitic love which the Spartans called the path of
virtue. They also encouraged this sort of love in the less austere
republics; the Thebans formed a battalion of young pederasts, and
these practices won the unanimous approbation of the philosophers
who all, from the virtuous Socrates to the fastidious Anacreon,
paraded their attachment to sodomy and their contempt for women,
who were relegated to second-class status, shut up as in a harem,
and banished from men's company.
As these bizarre tastes have not found favour in modern society, we
might reasonably be surprised that our philosophers have inherited
the classical thinkers' hatred of women, and that they continue to dis1 44

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
parage their sex because of a small number of stratagems forced on
women by the burden of their oppression, since any word or thought
of theirs that concurs with nature's design is turned into a crime.
The philosophers are so imbued with this tyrannical attitude that
they make great play of a few shrews in antiquity who responded
with asperity to words of courtesy. They praise the Germans who
have their wives lashed for one act of infidelity. They even debase
the female sex by their flattery of it, for what can be more inconsist­
ent than Diderot's claim that to write to women 'you must dip your
pen in the rainbow and sprinkle what you have written with the dust
of butter.fly wings'? 2 Women might reply to the philosophers: your
Civilisation persecutes us if we obey nature; we are obliged to
behave artificially, and to attend only to promptings that go against
our desires. In order to make us swallow your doctrines you have
to play on our illusions and use the language of deceit, as you do
with soldiers when you lull them with promises of laurels and
immortality to make them forget their wretched situation. If they
were really happy they would welcome being addressed in straight­
forward, truthful language of the sort which you are very careful to
avoid. The same goes for women: if they were free and happy they
would not be so eager to embrace illusions and cajolery, and you
would not need the help of the rainbow and butterflies to write to
them. If the military and the female sex, in fact the whole of the
common people, have to be deluded all the time, then that is a
serious indictment of philosophy for failing to organise anything in
this world except misery and servitude. And when it mocks
women's vices it is actually criticising itself, for it is philosophy
which produces these vices through a social system which represses
women's rights and abilities from childhood and throughout their
lives, forcing them to resort to deception if they are to obey their
natural impulses.
Any attempt to judge women by the behavioural failings they dis­
play in Civilisation is akin to j udging men by the character of the Rus­
sian peasant, who has no idea at all of honour or liberty, or to judging
beavers by the stupefaction they show in captivity, whereas working
together in the wild they become the most intelligent of the quadru­
peds. The same contrast will obtain between the enslaved women of
2

Diderot, Sur les femmes.
1 45

The Theory of the Four Movements
Civilisation and the free women of the combined order; they will sur­
pass men in their dedication to work, in loyalty and in nobility, yet
outside the free and combined state woman, like the captive beaver or
the Russian peasant, becomes a creature so inferior to her destiny and
capacities that it is easy to despise her if she is judged by superficial
appearances. We should not be surprised, therefore, that Mahomet,
the Council of Macon and the philosophers have all debated whether
women have souls, and have only thought about forging chains for
women, never about breaking them.
Women seem to need masters more than liberty, so they generally
give preference among their lovers to the ones whose conduct least
merits it. Yet how can women escape their penchant for servility
and betrayal when their education has taught them from childhood
up to stifle their natural character and adapt themselves to the first
man whom chance, intrigue or avarice chooses to be their husband?
One surprising thing is that women have always shown them­
selves superior to men when they have been able to develop their
natural abilities on the throne, where their crown ensures that they
are free to use them. It is common knowledge that out of eight
free, unmarried woman sovereigns, seven have had glorious reigns.
Whereas seven out of every eight kings are generally weak. And if
some women have not shone on the throne, it is because, like Mary
Stuart, they were hesitant and evasive in the face of amorous pre­
judices which they had to dare to overcome. Where they have taken
this course, what men would have been able to wield the sceptre
better? The Elizabeths and Catherines did not wage war themselves,
but they knew how to choose their generals, which is enough. Have
women not been able to teach men lessons in every other branch of
government? What prince has shown more resolution than Maria­
Theresa who, at a time when her subjects' loyalty was wavering and
her ministers were dumbfounded, took it upon herself to reinvigor­
ate everybody's courage? By her manner alone she was able to
intimidate the Diet of Hungary when it was far from disposed in
her favour, she harangued the Magnates in Latin until her enemies
were prepared to swear on their sabres that they would die for her.
This is an indication of the prodigies that female rivalry could per­
form in a social order which allowed women' s abilities free
development.

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
And would not you, the oppressive sex, outdo women in short­
comings if a servile education had brought you up, like them, to
think of yourselves as automata designed to submit to prejudice and
to grovel to the master that chance has brought you? Have we not
seen your claims to superiority confounded by Catherine, who
trampled the male sex under foot? By her appointment of favourites
she dragged man in the mud and proved that, despite his freedom,
he could debase himself further than women, whose degradation is
forced on them and therefore excusable. To put an end to the tyr­
anny of men there would have to be a century of a third sex, both
male and female, and stronger than the male. This new sex would
prove by the rod that men, as much as women, are made for its
pleasure; and then you would hear men protesting against the tyr­
anny of the hermaphroditic sex and admitting that might was not
the only guarantee of right. So why do they refuse to grant women
the privileges and independence they would demand from the third
sex?
This does not claim to be a critique of civilised education, nor
am I implying that women should be inspired with a sense of free­
dom. Every social period must, of course, bring up its youth to
respect the ruling absurdities. Just as in the barbarian order it is
necessary to brutalise women and persuade them that they do not
have souls so that they are prepared to be sold in the market and
shut up in harems, so women in Civilisation have to be stupefied
from childhood so that they fit in with philosophical dogmas, and
accept the servitude of marriage and the degradation of falling
under the control of a husband whose character may be the opposite
of their own. So just as I would blame a barbarian who brought up
his daughters in the customs of a Civilisation in which they were
never to live, so I would blame a civilised man who brought up his
daughters in a spirit of liberty and reason appropriate to the six and
seventh periods which we have not yet reached.
But to the extent that I am indicting contemporary education and
the servile spirit it induces in women, I do so by comparison with
other societies in which there will be no point in distorting their
character through prejudices. I · am demonstrating to them the
important role they will be able to play if they follow the example
of women who have overcome the influence of their education and

1 47

The Theory of the Four Movements
resisted the oppressive system necessitated by the bond of marriage.
By drawing attention to women who have been able to realise their
potential, from viragos like Maria-Theresa to those of gentler
character like the Ninons and the Sevignes, I have provided a basis
for saying that women, in a state of liberty, will outdo men in all
mental and physical functions which are not dependent on bodily
strength .
Men already seem to have a presentiment of this, becoming
frightened and indignant when women belie the prejudiced accu­
sation of their inferiority. The most striking outburst of masculine
jealousy has been directed against women writers: philosophy has
denied them academic honours and consigned them ignominiously
to the domestic sphere.
Yet this affront to female scholars was surely deserved. A slave
who tries to ape his master merits no more than a contemptuous
glance. Why should women become involved in the trite glory of
writing books, adding a few more volumes to the millions of useless
ones already in existence? Women should have been producing lib­
erators, not writers, political leaders like Spartacus, geniuses who
could plan ways of leading their sex out of degradation.
It is women who suffer most under Civilisation, and it is women
who should be attacking it. What kind of existence do they have
today? They live in continual privation, even in industry, where
men have taken over even the most meticulous work with the needle
and the pen, while women struggle with heavy work on the land.
Is it not a scandal to see strong men of thirty bent over a desk, or
using their rough arms to carry cups of coffee, as if there were not
enough women and children to attend to the delicate j obs in offices
and households?
What means of subsistence are available to women who have no
money? The bedpost or their physical charms, if they have any.
Yes, prostitution, naked or veiled, is their only means of support,
and philosophy would seek to deny them even that. This is the
abject condition they are reduced to by Civilisation and the conjugal
slavery they have never even thought about attacking. Since the
discovery of Tahiti, their failure to do so is unpardonable, as its
manners and customs stand as an admonition from nature which
ought to have suggested the idea of a social order capable of uniting
large-scale industry and amorous freedom. This was the only prob-

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
lem worth the attention of women writers, and their apathy in the
face of it is one of the causes of men's contempt for them. A slave
is never more contemptible than when blind submission convinces
the oppressor that his victim was born for slavery.
But instead of looking for ways of freeing their sex, educated
women have espoused philosophical egotism; they have shut their
eyes to the subjection of the companions whose sad fate they have
been able to escape; they have not sought ways to free them; and
that is why sovereigns who might have been able to help their sex
and who, like Catherine, had the good sense to scorn prejudice,
have done nothing to liberate women. But if they had published
some plans to that end, they would have been welcomed and tried
out as soon as a fair-minded prince or princess appeared on the
throne.
The study of this process of liberation was a task which fell to
female scholars. By their neglect of it they have tarnished their
literary reputation; it will be eclipsed, and posterity will only see
their egotism and their degradation. For although women writers
are generally capable of escaping the bonds of prejudice and
enjoying themselves, they nevertheless have a very poor track record
on the issue.
It seems to me that the tyranny of public opinion was enough to
irritate honourable women and incite them to attack prejudice, not
by useless declarations, but by seeking for some innovation that
might protect both sexes from the terrible and degrading condition
of marriage .
Yet far from lightening women's chains, the bias against their
liberty continued to increase: three accidents contributed to the con­
temporary establishment of a spirit of oppression against the weaker
sex.
The introduction of venereal disease, the danger of which
turns sensual pleasure into debauchery, and tends to restrict
the freedom of liaison between the sexes. (This disease will
be eradicated by the progressive household. )

3rd. The birth of Mohammedanism, which increased the misery
and degradation of women in barbarism, and thereby made
the less deplorable condition of women in Civilisation appear
in a misleadingly positive light.
These three incidents together proved disastrous, and closed the
way more than ever to any improvement founded on the loosening
of women's chains, unless by chance some ruler had appeared who
was hostile to p rej ud i ce and sufficiently far-sighted to try out in
one of his provinces the amorous arrangements I have described.
This act of j ustice was all that nature asked of our reason, and it
is as a punishment for our rebellion against her wishes that we have
failed to progress to the sixth and seventh periods and have
remained twenty-three centuries too long in the darkness of philos­
ophy and the horror of Civilisation.

To familiarise yourselves with the luxury I shall be describing, you
should re-read Note A, on the organisation of the progressive Series,
in order to understand how an order so contrary to our customs will
give diametrically opposite results, and produce as much magnifi­

You may complain that this is confusing, because the division is a

You must not lose sight of the fact that, in order to put the
wonders I shall describe into operation, the combined order will
have the help of four new passions which we have little or no sense
of in the civilised order, where everything is opposed to their
development.
These passions, which I have named

can only work freely in the progressive Series; and as we are not
used to such delightful passions they will seem as new as love seems
to young people when they experience it for the first time.
This view may not seem very comforting to those who have
already spent their best years in the gloom of Civilisation, but they
should take heart: these new pleasures will be for people of all ages,
and their anticipation should not be a cause for despair except
during the interval that must elapse until the foundation of the
combined order.
Splendour of the arts and sciences

Before considering the splendour of the arts and sciences in the
combined order, it is necessary to understand the immense rewards
conferred on artists and scientists.
Each year every phalanx votes by a simple majority on a list of
the inventions and compositions which have appeared in the course
of the previous twelve months and been acclaimed . Each product
is assessed by the competent Series: tragedies by the literature and
poetry Series, and so on for each new creation.
If a work is deemed worthy of recompense, the sum to be
awarded to the author is then assessed: Racine, for example, might
receive twenty sous for his tragedy Athalie.
Once the phalanx has drawn up a list of the prizes it has awarded,
it is sent to administrators who scrutinise the votes of the canton
and draw up a list for the province. This is then sent to the regional
administration, which does the same thing with all the provincial
lists. The vote-counting thus ascends by stages until it reaches the
ministries in Constantinople where the final scrutiny is conducted
and the names of the authors who have won the vote of the majority
of the globe's phalanxes are published. The winning author is
' The 1 84 1 edition, following Fourier's annotated copy, has: ' r nth The Dissident
(or Cabalist), 1 1 th The variant (or Butterfly), 1 2th The Enmeshing (or Composite),
1 3th Harmonyism (or Unityism).'

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
awarded the average of the sums voted by that majority: thus if a
million phalanxes voted for 10 sous, a million for 20 and a million
for 30, the prize awarded would be 20 sous.
Let us suppose that Racine was voted 1 livre for the tragedy
Atha/ie, and that Franklin received 3 livres for his invention of the
lightning conductor; the minister would give Racine drafts for the
sum of 3 million livres, and Franklin for 9 million, drawn on the
congresses of their regions, and the total cost would be shared
among the 3 million phalanxes of the globe.
In addition, Franklin and Racine would receive a decoration and
be declared citizens of the globe, and wherever they happened to
find themselves, in every phalanx they would enjoy the same privi­
leges as the magnates of the canton.
To the authors, these rewards are enormous, although their cost
to each phalanx is hardly perceptible. And they can be repeated
frequently. Racine and Franklin might well win another similar sum
the following year by producing another product that obtained the
vote of a majority of the globe. Even the smallest works can be
worth immense sums to their authors, as long as they are singled
out by public opinion; if the globe awarded
to Haydn,
to Lebrun,

1

sou for a symphony,
sous for an ode,

Haydn would receive 1 50,000 livres and Lebrun, 300,000 livres for
works which perhaps took them no more than a month to complete,
and they could earn this sum several times in a single year.
As for works like those by sculptors, which cannot be shown to
everyone on the globe, there are other ways of ensuring that these
can be rewarded by the whole world. The combined order can thus
ensure a huge fortune to anyone who possesses a major talent, in
any area, and neither artist nor scientist needs to canvass support
or find patronage.
Let us imagine, for instance, that Pradon3 has canvassed success­
fully enough to interest twenty or so neighbouring cantons (where he
has friends) in his version of Phe'dre, and t_hat he has managed to have
it acted there. Then let us imagine that those cantons are weak enough
to award Pradon a prize: what good will the vote of 20 phalanxes do
3

Nicolas Pradon ( 1 632--<JB), Phedre et Hyppolyte ( 1 677).
1 53

The Theory of the Four Movements
him, out of a total of three million? And think of the shame that will
fall on those twenty phalanxes when the ministry in Constantinople
publishes the breakdown of the votes. Looking at the lists, they will
see that an unknown Phedre, written by a man called Pradon, has
found supporters in twenty cantons out of the whole world, namely
such and such places, all the supporters being friends and associates
of the afore-mentioned Pradon. It is easy to see how an announcement
of that sort would shame the author, and the twenty cantons who sup­
ported him, in the eyes of the whole world . So what in fact would
happen, despite all Pradon's scheming, is that the twenty cantons
whose support he solicits will not want to expose themselves to insult,
nor give their vote to such a mediocre play; far from being able to hope
for I ,500 thousand votes or the votes of half the globe, it does not even
win support twenty leagues away, in the cantons where Pradon has no
close friends.
Thus in the combined order intrigue or patronage work against
bad writers rather than helping them, whereas a man with real talent
rapidly attains the height of fame and fortune without the aid of
either. There is only one way to succeed, and that is to please the
majority of the world's phalanxes. Exceptions will be extremely
rare. If some important person, such as a relative of the emperor,
decided to write a bad play or a bad poem, the work would become
known because of its author's position, and the globe might be
indulgent enough to give it a prize; but there are very few individ­
uals whom the whole globe would consider worthy of such partial­
ity, and the little favour they might win would present no obstacle
to the success of the genuine talents which at present seldom
achieve success, because they do not have the means to develop, do
not receive adequate recompense, and lack the skill in intrigue with­
out which nothing in Civilisation succeeds.
Let us now turn from the rewards of the combined order to a
consideration of their concrete influence on, for example, enter­
tainment.
Entertainment and knight-errantry

I said that there will be ways of enabling the globe to reward any artist
or scientist whose talents are localised, and cannot easily be judged by
the whole world. The skill of a famous surgeon or a famous singer
1 54

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
cannot be seen all over the globe in the way that the widely distributed
works of a poet or engraver can be. But they will receive an equal share
of the rewards I have described, which can rapidly run into millions
for those of transcendent merit. Every poor man will therefore do his
best to nurture some talent in his children, and the moment the child
achieves a modicum of success in the arts or sciences, the father will be
overcome with joy and overwhelmed with congratulations. All around
him people will be saying, 'Your child is going to be a famous writer,
or a famous playwright, he will win decorations, he will earn millions.'
And everybody knows how gratifying such predictions are to the ears
of poor parents [or even rich ones] .
Which people then will be the keenest to study? It will be the
poor and their children. And as the theatre is a pathway to any
work in the arts and sciences, even mechanics, which is much used
on the stage, poor people will be eager for nothing so much as to see
their children working and developing their abilities in the phalanx's
theatre under the direction of the rich, who, in every country, have
a particular fondness for running theatres. All children will conse­
quently be used to appearing, from a very early age, on the dramatic
or lyric stage, and will join a Series for declamation, singing, danc­
ing or playing instruments. They will all appear, whether rich or
poor, because the phalanx, as it puts on plays for itself and its
neighbours, will become an amateur theatre company: thus a canton
with a population of 1 ,ooo will have at least 800 actors or musicians
who can perform on holidays, as every child will have been brought
up on the stage, and will spontaneously have joined one of the
branches of the theatre. In the combined order a little child of four
will not dare put himself forward for admission to the chorus of
Neophytes (see Note A) and the parade if he cannot already take
his part in the dances and movements of the theatre.
In the chapter on The Study of Passionate Attraction (First part),
we saw that nature distributes all the dispositions necessary to excel
in the functions of society among 800 people at random. Thus a
canton with a population of 1 ,000 will necessarily include great
actors in every genre, as long as everybody's dispositions have been
developed and cultivated since childhood. This is what will happen
in the combined order: children are freed from the tyranny of preju­
dices and institutions; they turn naturally to the jobs for which
nature has destined them, and their progress in them is entirely due
1 55

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
to competition. The only stratagem needed to make excellent actors
of them is to take them en masse to the neighbouring cantons to see
the productions put on by their rivals, after which they will strive
to outdo them.
There is no need to ask who will pay for the theatres or opera
houses. There only needs one to be built for three million to arise,
one after another. If the cantons have a proper sense of competition
they will not rest until they have equalled their neighbours; and as
far as building a theatre goes, they all have Series of masons, car­
penters, mechanics, painters, etc. and they will be able to pay for
the building materials by putting on whatever kind of production
they like.
If every phalanx has a minimum of seven or eight hundred actors,
musicians and dancers, it will be able to provide itself with all the
entertainments enjoyed by a great capital city like Paris or London.
Even the poorest canton in the Alps or the Pyrenees will then pos­
sess an opera house comparable to the one in Paris; I could even
say superior to it, as in matters of the arts and the refinement of
taste, civilised education is incapable of the wonders that will be
achieved by the natural system of education.
If the actors of one canton are augmented by those of the neigh­
bouring cantons, imagine the splendour of the holiday entertain­
ments when all the virtuosi from a number of nearby phalanxes join
together to provide a gathering of talents which it would take a
dozen capitals like Paris to produce! And as even the poorest man
will be able to watch these entertainments, he will experience more
enjoyment than any potentate in Civilisation.
There is another splendid aspect to this good fortune, if we
assume that there will be visits by travelling enthusiasts, which will
be a frequent occurrence in the combined order, when travellers
will form great caravans of knight-errantry in search of adventures,
each displaying one particular character. One day there may be the
Rose Bands, who come from Persia and have a dramatic and lyrical
character, a few days later the Lilac Bands arrive from Japan and
reveal a poetic and literary character; and, over the course of a year,
the successive visits of these caravans provide wonderful feasts of
enjoyment for every lover of the arts and sciences. There will be
bands of every character, and they will not accept anybody, of either

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
sex, into their corporation, who will not maintain the honour of the
troop.
Let us assume that the Rose Bands from Persia arrive at the
outskirts of Paris; they are made up of three hundred male and
three hundred female knights-errant, all chosen from the Persians
most accomplished in the dramatic and lyric arts. The bands decide
to stop at the phalanx of Saint-Cloud: they arrive with great pomp
and set up a vast number of flags given to them on their travels, on
which are inscribed the exploits of the Rose Bands of Persia.
On their arrival at Saint-Cloud they are received by the resident
knighthood, which is composed of rich people who enjoy music and
drama and have formed a corporation to pay the bands of their
favourite character and to feast and entertain them.
As the Rose Bands are formed from the Persian elite, every man
or woman in the company will have been a Mole or a Contat4 in
their own phalanx. They are all among the best singers, dancers
and instrumentalists in Persia, and their performances are so out­
standing that they defy description. The region also brings together
its main talents to put on a display for them.
Meanwhile the Hydrangea Bands of Mexico arrive and set up in
competition with the Rose Bands of Persia, and the two troops try
to surpass each other in talent in the theatres of the phalanxes of
Saint-Cloud, Neuilly, Marly, etc. If the Rose Band is deemed to be
the better, it will receive a flag from the region to be displayed with
its other trophies, bearing the legend 'Defeat of the Hydrangea
Bands of Mexico at the Saint-Cloud phalanx' .
I n the course o f their travels, bands o f the same character group
together in preparation for encounters with their rivals so that they
can challenge them to displays of skill which will enchant the region
in which these battles take place, after which the bands take their
separate ways, not travelling together as our regiments would. If the
Rose Bands have indicated that their next stopping-place will be
the phalanx of Loiret, near Orleans, they will find deputations at

Fran�oise Contat ( 1760- 1 8 1 3), who also made her debut with the Comedic­
Fran�aise, became famous for her comedy roles, especially in Moliere and
Beaumarchais.

1 57

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
Saint-Cloud from the phalanxes between there and Orleans; these
will be made up of the most charming men and women, whose task
is to captivate and enveigle the Rose knights, attracting them to
cantons off the main road. Each phalanx will make a case for enter­
taining them for a day, and every knight, male and female, will find
the same eagerness in the phalanxes they agree to visit as the whole
band did at Saint-Cloud. Only the band's leaders stay on the main
road, and then on a predetermined day they all meet up again at
Orleans, preparatory to a grand entry into the phalanx of Loiret
where they will distinguish themselves by new feats of excellence.
Thus will travel these bodies of enthusiasts, in their caravans of
knight-errantry, leading a joyful existence wherever they go, profit­
ing from the entire human race and never incurring any expense,
as all their expenses everywhere are met by the resident knight­
hood.
We can now understand that, in the matter of entertainment, the
poorest man will, at no cost to himself, enjoy pleasures a hundred
times finer than anything rich sovereigns are able to witness today;
for he will frequently see contests between thousands of famous
actors, singers, dancers and instrumentalists, any one of whom
would today arouse the enthusiasm of the city and the court, while
the countryside is entirely deprived of such entertainment, and even
towns with a population of 1 00,000 cannot support a large theatre.
How mean, how pitifully languishing, the pleasures of Civilisation
are compared to those the least significant canton on the globe will
enjoy in the combined order!
Combined gastronomy, considered in its political,
material and passionate senses

Politics of combined gastronomy
I have given some idea of the tremendous differences, as far as
entertainments are concerned, between the pleasures of the com­
bined order and those of Civilisation, and of the extent to which
the poorest canton's amusements will surpass those of our most
opulent capital cities. The same comparison holds good for all kinds
of pleasure, particularly the principal ones, like love and good food .
Soon the amorous escapades of a Richelieu or a Ninon will seem

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
petty and pitiable compared with the amorous adventures that the
combined order will guarantee even the least favoured men and
women. The same will be true of the fare of the modern Apicius,
whose feasts, when set beside those of the combined order, will look
like the meals of gastronomically ignorant bumpkins.
Questions of love and good food are not taken seriously by the
civilised, who do not understand the importance God attaches to
our pleasures. Sensual pleasure is the only weapon God can use to
control us and bring us to carry out his designs; he rules the uni­
verse by attraction and not by constraint, so his creatures' enjoyment
occupies the most important place on God's calculations.
To show how wisely he has prepared our pleasures, I shall speak
about the excellent meals which will prevail in the new order. Read­
ers might perhaps prefer a digression on love in the new order, but
such a discussion might offend prejudices, whereas nobody will be
offended by a foretaste of the extended pleasures of the table, which
are still so limited today.
Good food only accounts for half the pleasures of the table, which
need to be stimulated by a judicious choice of dining companions,
something that Civilisation is powerless to achieve. The richest and
most refined of men cannot, even in his own household, assemble such
a well-assorted collection of guests as will be seen in the combined
order, and which even the poorest man will find at all his meals,
and which will change constantly in the course of every year.
It is because guests at our banquets are so often unsuited to one
another that civilised women care so little about the pleasures of
the table. Women set more store than men by the choice of their
fellow-diners; men are more exacting about the . quality of the
dishes. The two pleasures, exquisite food, and a stimulating variety of
guests, are continually associated in the combined order. Civilisation
cannot provide even one of them: to demonstrate this, I shall talk
about good food, which provides the whole structure's foundation.
It is a risky subject and it will only please trusting readers. Others
will exclaim at every point that it is impossible. They will have a
slight justification for this until it is demonstrated to them; but
some people want provisional accounts of the combined order they want the prospect before the theory. I must do something to
satisfy them in this prospectus, which has to take into account the
tastes of different kinds of readers.
1 59

The Theory of the Four Movements
To appreciate the resources that the combined order has to offer
in the way of good food, you must recognise that it is not densely
populated like Civilisation. Let us examine this in detail.
The theory indicates 800 or 8 1 0 inhabitants to each phalanx, with
the average extent of cantons being 3,456 toises in diameter. This
area is greater than a square league by a ratio of 87 to 63 . The
combined order will thus house scarcely 600 inhabitants per square
league of 2,500 toises.
In some places, like Wurttemberg, on the other hand, Civilisation
crowds more than 4,000 inhabitants into a square league, which is
seven times more than the proper number, and in average regions
there are normally 1 ,200 inhabitants per league, when there should
only be 600.
Given the bodily weakness of the civilised, 800 or 900 per league
might be permissible, but only as a temporary measure, with the
number being gradually reduced to 600 as new areas of the globe
are opened up and the human race increases in strength.
It will thus be necessary to clear those civilised regions which
are over-populated, generally those having more than 800 inhabi­
tants per square league, including towns. The overspill will not be
directed to the surrounding area, as from France to Spain, but to
different places in all the uncultivated countries. They will begin
to divide them into a chequer-board pattern, with lines of phalanxes
traversing Africa, America and Australia in order to bring enlight­
enment to those countries and unite with the indigenous hordes.
Some European regions, like Wurttemberg, will evacuate more
than 3,000 inhabitants per square league. This will be greatly to
the advantage of their rulers, who will have colonial stock or owner­
ship rights over a twelfth of the uncultivated land brought into
production by their emigrants.
If the agglomerations of population that cover some areas had to
be retained, it would be impossible to organise the combined order,
in which each canton is laid out like a royal residence, with hunting,
fishing, tall trees, exercise grounds and dual roads everywhere, with
one shaded and bordered with flowers for summer use. Above all,
each canton needs to have great areas of pasture for the many flocks
and herds which will be raised in the new order.
Luckily the earth is vast in proportion to its small population;
we are still only one-third of the globe's proper number, with our
small total of 2 billion. We can therefore expand where we like and
1 60

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
have ample room to live. It is so that we can make the best of this
good fortune that God has restricted our numbers so much, and
herded us together like captives on a few parcels of land that we
fight over, while the greater part of the globe remains uncultivated,
because of the danger of losing the colonies.
But henceforth there will be nothing to prevent people from dis­
persing, as the whole earth will be united under a single, unchang­
ing government, which will guarantee every prince a colonial
indemnity on the countries peopled by his superfluous subjects.
Although the combined order will temporarily have only 900,
and finally only 600, inhabitants per square league, this small
number formed into progressive Series will reap a harvest as large
as three times that number of incoherent farmers could produce from
the same ground.
I do not claim that the combined order will be able to raise a
hundred grains of corn from a head that only yields thirty today.
There are some things, like cereals, which there are few ways of
perfecting; for wheat, I foresee only four, namely: first, the choice
of the best seed, and its adoption throughout the world; second,
the even range of temperature which will become established in all
climates; third, irrigation, which will be extended to include not
only fields but also forests; fourth, portable tents which can be
placed over any patch of ground to protect it from too much sun
or rain. Despite all these improvements, the cereal yield will only
increase by a ratio of 2 to 3; but in other areas, like fruit, woodland,
livestock, etc . , the combined order will triple the productive
capacity of the incoherent order.
Taking all these variations into account, we should estimate the
positive production of the combined order at double that of the pre­
sent. To this should be added the negative production contributed
by avoidance of waste. If, therefore, I add in the almost incalculable
waste involved in the civilised mechanism (which I mentioned
'
briefly in the preliminary discourse, and which I shall have more
to say about in the third part, when I deal with the commercial
mechanism) it will be clear that production that is positively double
ours will become negatively triple by avoiding the huge amount of
waste we create.
As harvests in the combined order will greatly exceed the means
of consumption both locally and abroad, surpluses will become a
periodic scourge in the way shortages are today, and even while

The Theory of the Four Movements
feeding animals on human foodstuffs, it will be necessary to dump
a mass of produce which could grace the best tables today in the
sea and down the drain. It is a sacrifice which will be made without
regret, however, as the surplus will be necessary to sustain the com­
bined order, since this social order will have to stabilise its popu­
lation at a limit which allows for regular surpluses and the destruc­
tion of a quantity of good produce. For example, if the phalanx of
Vaucluse harvests 50,000 melons or water melons, about 1 0,000 of
these will be assigned for its own consumption, 30,000 for export
and 10,000 sub-standard ones will be shared amongst the horses
and cats, or used for compost.
Economists will respond by arguing that the phalanx should raise
more pigs to consume this surplus, but there would be no point in
this, as there would soon be a surplus of pigs as well as of melons
and other fruit. It is therefore better to use the surplus fruit for
compost than to feed extra animals which there will be no way of
consummg.
Economists will then argue that the population should be
increased in order to use up this surplus. But in the combined
order, the population cannot be raised beyond a given proportion,
because if those numbers are exceeded the Series will not be able
to carry out their functions properly, and they will collapse into
discordant mobs instead of operating in harmony and attraction.
The population must therefore be limited approximately to the pro­
portions indicated by the theory, resulting in this habitual surplus
which even the animals will not be able to consume. In short, it is
a property of the combined order always to produce a surplus which
has to be returned to the land, j ust as the incoherent order con­
stantly produces a deficit which gives rise to poverty.

The raw material of combined gastronomy
What will be the quality of the surplus that will have to be divided
between the animals and compost?
The answer to this question may cast some unexpected light on
the fate of people in the future. I would therefore ask readers to
pay particular attention to the detail of what follows, as the con­
clusions it will reach are truly surprising, and will provide some
idea of the immensity of well-being God has prepared for us.
1 62

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
In progressive Series all the groups will develop a high degree
of dexterity because of the extent to which tasks will be sub­
divided. Each member will therefore only work at jobs where he
can excel. The leaders of the Series, impelled by rivalry to make
a serious study of their craft, will bring to their work all the
knowledge of a master. Their subordinates will approach their
work with an enthusiasm that will make light of all difficulties,
and a fanatical determination to maintain the honour of the Series
against rival cantons. In the heat of action they will do things
that seem not to be humanly possible, like the French grenadiers
scaling the rocks of Mahon and next day being unable to climb
the rock in cold blood which they had successfully attacked under
enemy fire. That is what the progressive Series will be like at
work: all obstacles will fall before the force of their pride, the
word impossible will make them angry, and the most difficult
tasks, such as earth-moving, will be no more than games. If we
today could see a canton organised, see thirty or so industrial
groups parading outside the phalanx palace, dispersing to the
fields and workshops, waving their banners with cries of triumph
and impatience, we would think we were witnessing bands of
fanatics bringing fire and bloodshed to the neighbouring cantons.
It is athletes like these who will take the place of our reluctant
and mercenary workers, and who will produce crops of nectar
and ambrosia from soil which under the feeble hand of Civilis­
ation yields nothing but thorns and dame! .
Every phalanx, as it exploits the resources of a canton made
fertile by earth-works, irrigation and other means, will take par­
ticular care to stifle at birth any animal or vegetable produce
which shows signs of imperfection and therefore would not main­
tain the honour of the canton and its Series. Thus everything
that tends towards mediocrity is destroyed at birth, and even the
surplus food given to the animals is at least as good as the
produce which we admire at the table of kings and other great
figures. If you could preserve some item of food, a chicken, say,
from the finest table in France today, and produce it in the
combined order, anyone who tasted it would point out twenty
faults in the way it had been bred and fattened, and conclude
that the Series of poultry-farmers responsible for rearing it and
for allowing it to appear at the table instead of being thrown

The Theory of the Four Movements
away, deserved to be eclipsed, that is, condemned to attach a
black tassel to their group's banner.
If the general enthusiasm and intelligence that characterise work
in the combined order raise production to such a level of excellence
that rejected animals are as good as the choicest meat served at the
tables of the great, the lowest or third-quality meat will already be
superior to the best we can produce. It follows that the food sent
to the ordinary people's kitchens will be finer than the food we
reserve for kings. This is what the theory tells us, and although you
may suspect me of some exaggeration, I have in fact done my best
to tone down the descriptions in order to make it seem credible.
There will be a similar degree of refinement in the preparation
of food, as every phalanx's kitchen Series will bring the same
enthusiasm to their jobs as all the other Series; they will attach the
same importance to all their tasks as a certain French chef did, who
blew his brains out as dinner was about to be served because he
thought his honour was compromised by the fish arriving late. This
will be the attitude of the Series which run the kitchens of every
phalanx; their intelligence will be borne out by the exquisite quality
of their seasoning; where they use just a single clove, it will be
superior in quality to any that Asia can supply today, as the lowest­
grade, third quality will be better than the most perfect that Civilis­
ation can supply.
Thus the third-class dishes, the everyday fare of the ordinary
people, will surpass any of our gastronomes' delights. As for the
variety of dishes at their table, there will be at least thirty or forty
of them, a third of which will be changed each day, with a dozen
different kinds of drink at every meal.
One-third of this food would of course be sufficient to surpass
anything the people might desire: but mediocrity and moderation
have no place in the combined order, and as the progressive Series
provide a plentiful variety of produce, consumption must follow
suit. If the Series which grows apples and pears has provided thirty
varieties, a few of which are so abundant that they lose most of
their value, these must be eaten by the common people; and they
cannot be served just one kind of fruit, because the fruit-growers'
Series which arranges their distribution sends assortments of every
kind of fruit to the kitchen each day, not j ust one. The common
people must therefore be served a selection of third-grade fruit

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
which cannot be offered at the tables of the middle-class and the
rich.
In the current order, where there is very little variety of produce,
most of it is reserved exclusively for the rich, and not only are the
common people unable to enjoy it, but even the bourgeoisie has to
do without it. Their fortune is very different in the combined order,
in which a single canton may raise at least 800 different sorts of
produce, two-thirds of which will be sufficiently abundant for some
to be assigned for consumption by ordinary people. Their diet will
therefore revolve around a variety of some 600 different foods, while
the rich may have three or four times that number because of food­
stuffs imported from foreign countries. Despite this, though, ordi­
nary people will still have a copious selection of all sorts of products,
and I have probably underestimated them in reckoning three dozen
dishes and a dozen drinks as the everyday fare at a third-class table,
which will feed 400 to 500 individuals in their different parties in
the dining-rooms of the minimum.
You would be a great deal more surprised if I went into the detail
of the composition of these dishes, the special qualities of which are
particularly interesting.
When the torrid zone has been brought into full cultivation,
sugar, the poorest kinds of which will be as good as our finest, will
be equal in value to wheat flour, so that ships coming from the
equator will exchange a cargo of the purest sugar for an equivalent
weight of European flour. But in Europe, good dairy produce and
good fruit will be so common that little value will be set on them.
Fine jams and purees or creams made of sugar and fruit or dairy­
produce in equal proportions will cost less than bread, and for econ­
omy's sake poor children will be given qu anti ti es of matched fine
jams, cream, sugar and stewed fruit. I say matched because the
Series of cooks, confectioners and the rest can only work by match­
ing or graduated progression, and consumption has to operate in
the same way. Consequently the poorest children everywhere will
find their tables loaded with the sugared dairy-products and candied
fruits they are so fond of, and which seem to be harmful to their
temperament because we cannot provide them with the acidic
:!rinks which would counteract the vermicular influence of these
mbstances. But as soon as the torrid zone is cultivated, lemonade
md other costly drinks will be as plentiful as small beer and cider

The Theory of the Four Movements
are now. Lemons in the torrid zone, and pippin apples in the
temperate zone, will be so abundant that their only cost will be
transport, and that they will be exchanged at equal weight, to the
great contentment of both zones. We can see from this why nature
has given children of all countries a liking for jam, sweetened cream,
lemonade, etc . : it is because these will be the cheap food of children
in the combined order, and God has to give us passionate attraction
to the kind of life reserved for us in the new order, when bread will
be among the rarest and most expensive of foods, and when the
only foundation of universal harmony will be on passions refined
enough to require the involvement of three zones and two conti­
nents in the service of every inhabitant of the globe.
I realise how exaggerated these and the following claims may
seem, but I have already said that a complete demonstration of them
belongs in a full account of the mechanism of the progressive Series;
until I have published this theory readers cannot expect proofs of
these provisional descriptions, which I have included to satisfy the
most impatient of them.
Although this digression on the raw material of meals is already
too long for a vague foretaste, there are a few more lines to add.
There would be many complaints if I forgot to call upon the god
of the vine to put in an appearance in this gastronomic excursus .
This is the point where some specious arguments may b e raised
against me. My opponents will try to cast discredit on the cellars
of the combined order, because their kitchens will accumulate so
many trophies. Listen to what they have to say: 'We grant you',
they will tell me, 'that your phalanxes, your Series and your groups
can provide such an abundance of exquisite produce that even the
poor will share in it; but could you match that divine food every­
where in the globe with correspondingly fine wines, that would bear
comparison with those of Medoc, Ay, Chambertin, Rtidesheim,
Jerez, Tokay, etc.? Their vineyards, limited in size, will not be able
to provide enough for the first-class tables in three million cantons,
and so the good food of the common people will have to be washed
down with poor-quality wine, which will make for gastronomic
cacophony, as you cannot have a good meal without good wine. To
accompany a meal whose plainest dishes utterly surpass those of a
modern Apicius, everywhere would have to have wines superior to
those from our famous vineyards which occupy tiny areas of land,
and which no amount of work will ever be able to equal, as their
1 66

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
characteristic flavours derive from the places where they are grown,
not from the work that is put into them.'
This objection would seem to be an awkward one, and I am
happy to pose it plainly, in order to demonstrate that the solution
to the greatest problems is mere child's play to anyone who accepts
the theory of Social Movement. Yes, in the combined order a poor
man will drink wines at his table equal to the most renowned wines
of France, Spain and Hungary; and consequently the rich will have
a choice of wines that are proportionately superior.
Nor is this all, for I shall show that where other drinks are con­
cerned the tables of the poor will be better provided than those of
kings are today. My examples are of three types, bitter, sweet and
acidic; they are coffee, milky drinks and lemonade, all of which will
be in every respect more exquisite than the best that kings can
obtain. Their superiority will be due to the ways they are grown,
transported and prepared, none of which can be duplicated in the
present order and which kings could not provide at any price. Do
you think coffee is grown as well as it could be in the fields of
Mocha? Are there not major errors in the way it is collected and
transported, perhaps even in its usual preparation? When you
understand the care and discernment that the grouped Series will
take over each detail you will realise that our most renowned prod­
ucts are infinitely far from perfection. If we add that future events
will perfect the earth's sap, and thereby refine the sap of the plants
and animals which it nourishes, it will not be surprising that the
drinks left to the poorest of men will often be superior to those of
civilised potentates.
However, this improvement in the earth's sap will only come
about slowly, as it will depend not on agricultural works, but solely
on the gradual rise in temperature which will take a long time,
generations, to complete, and will not be fully established until after
the creation of the northern crown and the cultivation of the entire
polar region . The crown will be the main source of these new saps
which will refine produce, and give the least of the globe's wines a
taste equal to the most esteemed wines of today.1
' '[In 1 803 I was as yet unaware of a future event which would affect the variety
of tastes, namely the return of our five living moons: Vesta, Juno, Ceres, Pallas
and Mercury. By using the aromas which they will emit, singly or in combination,
it will be possible to give 32 different flavours, in addition to its natural flavour,
to 32 different beds of the same plant.]' ( 1 84 1 ) .

The Theory of the Four Movements
Other causes will also influence this alteration in the earth's saps,
and here I must reiterate a point I have already made, namely that
the combined order creates opportunities and means to put them
into practice which do not exist for us. The resources of Civilisation
can give no idea of the resources of the combined order; for
example, if every scholar today had to be awarded millions upon
millions each time he produced a good book or a new discovery,
the people of Civilisation would exclaim that no regime could sus­
tain such prodigality, that kings would have to have inexhaustible
treasuries, that all the ministries would have to become patrons, the
passions would have to be changed, etc. Yet we saw, at the begin­
ning of this notice, that the problem will be resolved without any
need to change the passions or the nature of ministries or kings.
The solution lies in the fact that the combined order creates means
that are unknown to Civilisation, and that once we are provided
with these new means, obstacles regarded as insurmountable will
present no difficulties at all. After all, with the aid of compass and
explosives, we are able to split rocks, to brave the darkness of the
seas and do all sorts of amazing things the mere idea of which would
have made the whole of the ancient world shudder. The same will
be true of all the problems I have described, and which arouse
accusations of impossibility and charlatanism from you. All your
objections are systematically resolved by the mechanism of the pro­
gressive Series, and the results of this order will provide not only
the objects of your desires, but a happiness far beyond anything
you can desire.

Passionate mechanism of combined gastronomy
These material pleasures that I describe are insufficient in them­
selves; it is not enough for the poorest among you to have a
table better provisioned with food and drink than the richest of
kings. The well-being that this provides, however real, will only
ensure half the pleasures of the table. For although good food
provides the basis, there is another no less essential condition,
the judicious mix of fellow-diners, the art of varying and match­
ing the parties, making them more interesting each day by cre­
ating delightful and unexpected encounters, assuring even the
poorest people of spiritual pleasures which are never to be had
1 68

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
in your normal household gloom. On this point, your Civilisation
is completely absurd. Your costly gatherings and your most cele­
brated banquets are generally so badly arranged and the guests
so ill-matched that everyone would die of boredom if it were
not for the food. But food alone is a boorish pleasure, and
perhaps not even that; for peasants are jovial and lively enough
in their taverns, enjoying the pleasures of the senses and the
spirit together, whereas people have to yawn away a solid hour
waiting in fashionable drawing rooms for their dinner. And oh!
how dearly you have to pay for the dinner with the boredom of
keeping up faltering discussions about rain and good weather,
the health of friends and relations, the progress of the worthy
children of virtuous fathers, the good behaviour of daughters,
the kind nature of aunts, and the tender sentiments of tender
dispositions. What a deluge of insipid nonsense you get at these
civilised gatherings, even though no expense has been spared in
their preparation and in the outlay on good food! The whole
occasion is as tedious for the guests as it is for the mistress of
the house, who has all the trouble of arranging and preparing it.
How on earth can civilised people dare to lay claim to gastro­
nomic excellence when they know nothing of the art of organising
the stimulating and varied parties which constitute half the pleas­
ure of the table! It seems that on this point kings are even worse
off than their subjects. They are reduced to eating with their
families, as isolated as hermits and as solemn as owls throughout
their meals, thus demonstrating that at table, as elsewhere, the
pleasures of the most powerful kings are inferior to those the
poorest of his subjects will enjoy in the combined order. Added
to which the sovereign must think himself lucky if, amidst the
isolation and gloom of his meals, he can forget the ever-present
threat of being poisoned. Oh how vain are the pleasures of
Civilisation!
At this point I should explain how the various gatherings of
the combined order are organised, and how successful meals are
arranged for lovers, families, corporations, friends, strangers, etc.
In order to arrange this Series of meals, as well as the jobs
of work which will change every two hours, even the smallest
canton in the world' wil! a hold a daily exchange or negotiating
' There cannot be any with fewer than 600 people.

The Theory of the Four Movements
assembly. This is where they sort out the gatherings for work
and pleasure of the next few days, and the loans of cohorts
between cantons in which they j oin together for purposes of
work or enjoyment. Every day, each canton's exchange negotiates
at least eight hundred gatherings for work, meals, amorous affairs,
travel and other purposes. Each of these meetings requires dis­
cussion among ten, twenty or even a hundred individuals, and
there are at least twenty thousand schemes to sort out in the
space of an hour. To ensure the smooth running of this there
are all sorts of officers and arrangements whereby any individual
can be involved in thirty or so discussions at the same time, so
that even the smallest canton's exchange is more lively than the
London or Amsterdam stock exchanges. Most of the negotiation
is done through signals by means of which each leading nego­
tiator can enter into discussion from his desk with every individ­
ual and make plans, via his assistants, for twenty groups, twenty
Series, twenty cantons at once, without uproar or confusion.
Women and children take part in these negotiations as well as
men to fix up all their gatherings, and the tussles this gives rise
to every day provide the most stimulating game, the briskest and
most complicated scheming, that there could possibly be. The
exchange is therefore a major entertainment in the combined
order.
After the foretaste I have given you of the pleasures of the
table, you will be able to recognise that the pleasures of love
will be equally intensified; every day they will present a host of
anecdotes and adventures, the least of which will be superior to
our proudest achievements. Like the table, love will provide
opportunities for all characters. There will be no more pointless
arguments about constancy and inconstancy and who is attached
to whom . There will be tastes of every sort in the combined
order, because there will be means of satisfying them all. Bac­
chants will be as necessary as vestals, and attraction will only be
able to operate if all kinds of love exist in the canton. So
alongside the bacchants who practise the virtue of fraternity and
devote themselves to the pleasure of the whole human race, you
will find vestals and maidens of complete fidelity; you will also
find something much rarer, men who are faithful to women, who

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
are not to be found in Civilisation, except among the devotees
of pietism who are not part of the amorous world .
The amorous policy for recruiting armies

The announcement of the amorous freedom which is to come is
bound to arouse the anger of the bourgeoisie and the philosophers,
and to calm them down it will be best to encourage them to envisage
this freedom in relation to their self-interest, which is the only god
they recognise. Love, which in Civilisation is a source of disorder,
idleness and expense, will become a source of profit and industrial
miracles in the combined order. I shall give an example of this, and
I have decided to demonstrate it by looking at one of the most
difficult tasks of government in Civilisation, the recruitment of
armies, which in the combined order will be achieved by its amor­
ous policy.
In each phalanx love will create two major Series, the half­
character and the whole character. Each of these will be subdivided
into nine branches, beginning with the Vesta/ate which I shall now
describe.
In each phalanx, the chorus of Lads and Maidens, who are all
virgins, every year elect a quadrille of vestals composed of two show
couples and two couples of merit: the former are chosen for their
beauty, the latter, for their achievements in the arts and sciences,
or for their devotion to their work.
The vestals always occupy the rank of magnates. When even the
poorest girl is elected a vestal she travels in a carriage studded with
jewels and drawn by six white horses. Honours of every sort are
bestowed on these young people; they command the columns of
children; in short, the system that preserves virginity tends to bring
young girls to the fore rather than isolating them. Far from making
them behave foolishly like our morality-plagued maidens, who say
they love nobody and only want what mummy and daddy want,
they develop their own inclinations as fully as they can, and the
female and male vestals both have their recognised suitors.
This youthful elite has the privilege of joining the industrial
armies, which are magnificent gatherings, and it is during their cam­
paigns that the vestals have their first love affairs. Every day, after

The Theory of the Four Movements
work, the industrial armies hold festivities, whose glittering splen­
dour is increased by the participation of this elite of youthful beauty
and talent. They offer tremendous scope for courtly behaviour: all
the vestals' suitors follow them, and they make their choices in the
course of the campaign. Those young people who want to attach
themselves to a single lover join the ranks of the Squires and Dam­
sels, and join the groups of constant lovers, the second of the nine
amorous characters; others, who prefer inconstancy, join the other
seven groups. The main result of these diversions is that immense
industrial armies are formed, without any compulsion and without
any ruse except the public display and public honouring of vir­
ginity, which the philosophers would rather keep hidden away from
society, surrounded with chaperones and prejudices.
All that has to be done to raise an army is to publish a list of
the quadrilles of virgins selected by each phalanx. Their declared
suitors will then have to follow them into the armies as that is where
the vestals' choices will be made. This will be done secretly, with
none of the dreadful publicity that surrounds our marriage cere­
monies, when the whole town is informed that on a particular day
some libertine or rake will deflower an innocent girl. Only those
born and brought up in Civilisation could endure the sight of those
indecent customs called weddings, with interventions by both priest
and magistrate, as well as the local drunks and j okers. And why
does this happen? Because after the vile intrigues that take place
and after the pimping conducted by lawyers and godparents, two
individuals are going to be yoked together for life, despite the fact
that after a month they may hate the sight of each other. So what
motive can there be for these wedding feasts? The desire for pos­
terity? But they do not know that the wife will not be sterile. The
hope that the couple will be happy together? But who can tell
whether they will not detest each other in a year's time, and if their
union will not be a misery to both of them? By basing their festivit­
ies on such vague hopes, the families are behaving like some hare­
brained idiot who buys a lottery ticket and then invites his neigh­
bours to a great dinner to celebrate the prize he hopes to win.
Everyone eats his food while they make fun of him, saying he has
not won it yet. When you give feasts to celebrate a marriage, you
are j ust behaving like that idiot, because marriage is a lottery ticket.
In fact, it is worse, because not only may it fail to produce the

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
happiness you hope for, it can also create a great deal of unhap­
piness. The only situation in which there is a reason for festivity
is when a man marries a very rich woman: then it is right to rejoice.
But most wives spend more money than they bring with them; and
if wedding celebrations were to be delayed until a year later, by
which time the husband would have experienced some of the diffi­
culties of the arrangement, like the great expense, and the cuckoldry
which is bound to happen sooner or later, you would not find many
husbands disposed to celebrate their unfortunate union. How many
of them indeed regret it the day after, when they are already dis­
comfited at not finding what they thought they would find!
In the combined order, celebrations of first love only happen after
the union has been consummated. They do not imitate Civilisation
and make the public witnesses to the bargain struck for a maiden­
head. The female vestals can see all their suitors gathered together,
displaying their talents in the army's work and public games; their
number gradually diminishes as the vestals encourage some and dis­
courage others. When, finally, a vestal comes to an agreement with
one of them, the young couple have only to send a sealed declaration
to the High-Matron (who is a minister of amorous relations with
responsibility for overseeing the army's love affairs as far as they
concern the vestals) or else to one of the Vice-Matrons in charge
of each division. Every evening the necessary arrangements are
made to receive the couples who want to form secret unions; they
are identified by an official from the Matronate, but the union is
not publicly announced until the following day, when the vestal
changes her crown of lilies for a crown of roses and appears in the
dress of a Damsel with her favourite, or if she has chosen a male
vestal, her Squire.
A considerable number of these unions of male and female vestals
takes place every night of the army's campaign. They are announced
the next day at the matinal or morning meal. The male and female
bacchants have the job each morning of bringing in and comforting
the wounded, that is, the suitors who have been rejected as a result
of the night's secret unions.
Let us imagine, for example, that the vestal Galatea is almost
ready to make her final choice, but is still undecided between Pyg­
malion, Narcissus and Pollux. In the end she chooses Pygmalion,
and forms a secret union with him. The same night about a hundred
1 73

The Theory of the Four Movements
other vestals have consummated similar unions with their favourites
in the building reserved for this ceremony. The next day, a thou­
sand bacchants of both sexes assemble before dawn, and a clerk of
the Matronate gives them a list of the night's unions and a list of
all the wounded who have to be looked after. Among these are the
names of Narcissus and Pollux, so the female bacchants who think
Pollux is fondest of them set off to his quarters, while others go in
search of Narcissus . Similarly, the male bacchants go and look for
the attractive wounded females whom they have chosen.' Pollux will
thus be woken by bacchants carrying a myrtle branch, who will
explain that he has lost Galatea's affections, bear the brunt of his
shock, his cries of treachery and ingratitude, and then use all of
their charms and eloquence to console him.m
Every morning, there are plenty of defeated suitors, much to the
joy of the legions of bacchanalians who reap benefits from this
amorous martyrdom, as the usual remedy for such misadventure in
love is a few days drowning one's sorrows with the bacchants, the
adventuresses and others of the army's philanthropic corporations.
When people learn the details of these different activities, and the
mechanisms of the amorous Series in the armies of the combined
order, they will find the love affairs of Civilisation so boring and
1

m

It goes without saying that if the rejected lovers are members of the Vestalate,
they will not be consoled by bacchants. In those cases, they will be comforted by
members of other brotherhoods, such as the sentimentalists, who make up the
seventh group of the amorous Series. There are numerous similar exceptions which
I shall not describe now, but which readers will be able to imagine for themselves.
Some of the civilised will say that Pollux will not want any part of the bacchants'
consolation, that if he is really in love with Galatea, he will contemptuously reject
these abandoned women who come and offer themselves to him. And indeed this
would be characteristic of love in the civilised order: for days Pollux would reject
all women except Galatea, and probably also challenge Pygmalion to a duel. In
the barbarian order, Pollux would act differently: he would stab Galatea to death
and then look for a chance to do the same to Pygmalion. In the savage or patriar­
chal order, Pollux would behave differently again. Thus I am well aware that
according to our customs Pollux should spurn the bacchants and their conso­
lations. But if you want to follow civilised custom and blame Pollux for seeking
distraction with the bacchants, you lay yourself equally open to the mockery of
barbarians for not plunging your dagger into the heart of the man who carries off
the girl you love. My reason for going into such detail here is to reiterate that
the passions operate differently in each social period, and that although some of
the practices of the combined order may seem bizarre to us, we should not judge
them before reaching an understanding of the circumstances which give rise to
customs so different from our own.
1 74

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
pitiful that they will not be able to bear to read our novels and
plays. They will also realise that admission to the armies will be a
privilege in the combined order, so there will be twice as many
volunteers as are necessary. Thus by relying on nothing but love it
will be possible to assemble a hundred and twenty million legion­
naires of both sexes to carry out works, the very idea of which
would send shivers of fear into our mercenary hearts. For example,
the combined order will undertake the conquest of the great Sahara
desert. It will be attacked at several points by IO or 20 million
hands, if necessary, and by dint of importing earth, and gradual
planting and afforestation, they will succeed in humidifying the
land, stabilising the sands, and replacing desert with fertile regions.
There will be ship canals in places where today we cannot even
create irrigation channels, and great ships will not only sail through
isthmuses like Suez and Panama but far inland, as from the Caspian
Sea to the Sea of Asov and the Aral Sea; they will sail from Quebec
to the five Great Lakes, and from the sea to every great lake, as
long as its length is at least a quarter of the distance between it and
the sea.
In every empire the various legions of men and women are div­
ided into a number of armies, who join forces with armies from
neighbouring empires. In the combined order no undertaking is
attempted using only a single army: at least three will work together
so as to engender a spirit of rivalry amongst them. If the sandy
heathland of Gascony needs to be covered with soil, the job will be
done by three armies, one French, one Spanish and one English,
and in return France will send an army to Spain and one to England
to help them in tasks of their own. In that way all the empires
of the globe will intermingle. This principle will apply equally to
provincial armies and work at the cantonal level.
Let us suppose that the phalanx of Tivoli wants to mow a
meadow, and that 300 men could do the job in two hours; if it only
has 60 available reapers it borrows 4 cohorts from four neighbouring
cantons, using its ambassadors to the cantons to negotiate the loan
in their Exchange, and on the day appointed 4 cohorts arrive and
join the Tivolians in the meadow. The hay-making is followed by
a meal with beautiful women from the different cantons. In return,
the canton of Tivoli will send cohorts of its men and women when
the others need them. This exchange of cohorts is one of the means
1 75

The Theory of the Four Movements
used in the combined order to transform even very tiresome work
into occasions of festivity. It becomes pleasant:
Because the large number of co-operative workers makes it
brief;
Because the gathering of cohorts brings together men and
women from different phalanxes;
And because the number of the workers enables the task to be
completed with elegance and precision.
The last point should be emphasised . Our workshops are so filthy
and so unpleasant that they create a feeling of disgust for work and
workers, particularly in France, which seems to be dirt's adoptive
country. Is there anything more revolting than the laundries in Paris
where high society's linen is washed? In the combined order these
sewers will be replaced with a building embellished with marble
basins fitted with taps for water at different temperatures, so that
women will not have to ruin their hands by plunging them into icy
or boiling water. Numerous arrangements will also be made to ease
the work by using all sorts of mechanical devices; and after the four
or five cohorts of laundresses from different cantons have finished
their work, the meal they share will be made as delightful as
possible.
These details may seem unimportant, but I have described them
at some length in order to demonstrate that all obstacles to work
have been anticipated . Bringing different cohorts together in this
way is only one of the many methods by which the combined order
will iron out all difficulties and provide means of accomplishing the
most unpleasant tasks by attraction and rivalry.
Useless as it is today, love will become one of the most brilliant
incentives of the social mechanism. And while it costs Civilisation
a great deal of trouble and coercion to raise the destructive armies
which periodically ravage the earth, the combined order will use
love and attraction to form beneficent armies which will strive to
outdo each other in the creation of magnificent monuments. Instead
of devastating thirty provinces in a single campaign, these armies
will span rivers with thirty bridges, level thirty mountains, dig
thirty irrigation canals and drain thirty marshes. Yet these triumphs
of industry will still be a mere fraction of the wonders performed
as a result of amorous liberty and the downfall of philosophy.

Second part: The p rivate or domestic destinies
In all these seemingly trivial discussions about things like good
food and love, we must not lose sight of the purpose of the com­
bined order, which is to operate industrial attraction. All this order's
arrangements that I have described, which you may think are
designed for pleasure, have to satisfy two touchstones: they must
produce industrial attraction and economy of incentive. I shall give
you a demonstration of this, drawn from the bands of knight­
errantry who travel the globe, and which I talked about earlier in
this account.
These bands, which young people find very attractive, will not
allow people to join them unless they have taken part in at least
three campaigns in industrial armies, as well as having the necessary
knowledge of the character the band is devoted to. Here we have
one more incentive for raising armies. Besides love, which brings
in the vestals of both sexes, and the curiosity aroused by the great
events which occur within the army, and the desire to be present
at the festivals and bacchanals, and share in the glory of their great
achievement - besides all these, there are other stimuli, like the
wish to achieve the status of adventurer or adventuress after three
campaigns, and to enjoy the hospitality of the globe with the bands
of knight-errantry. After six campaigns there are further privileges
to be won; and after taking part in nine, they can enter the world­
wide corps of paladins, officers of the emperor and empress of unity.
At the end of each campaign the young people are entitled to an
ornamental emblem, such as a cross or a star, inscribed with the
army's achievement, and the number of points on the stars desig­
nates the different campaigns each person has been on. These dec­
orations are worn by women because they always form half of each
industrial army.
The variety of enticements that the armies offer to young people
means that they assemble spontaneously at the first call for volun­
teers, and admission to their ranks, as I have said, becomes a privi­
lege won by the trials they go through. This method of raising
armies thus achieves the two aims I have spoken of, industrial attrac­
tion and economy of incentives.
And as the attraction of joining these wandering bands is one of
the lures drawing young people into the army, you will see that
they are not just vaguely imagined pleasure parties, and that all the
other arrangements which will be made for you in the combined
1 77

The Theory of the Four Movements
order will, like them, have to contribute to those two required
results, industrial attraction and economy of incentives. And the meas­
ures which lead to these two ends are all as immense and romantic
as the ones I have given you a provisional idea of.
Being afraid to show you the full, vast scope of these pleasures,
I have restricted myself to two minor aspects, love and good food.
I have talked about the tables of the poor but have said nothing
about the sumptuousness of those of the rich, when good food will
be enhanced by universal agriculture, by even temperatures refining
the earth's saps, by putting an end to commercial fraud, and by
universal freedom of communication. Then, in every phalanx, every
day, at each of the five meals,• the rich will be able to savour hun­
dreds of rare foods from all over the globe, transported and pre­
served by methods which are impossible in the imperfect state of
the industries of land and sea in Civilisation.
Similarly I have only touched on the least of the pleasures of
love by talking about the vestalate, which only allows courtship or
spiritual pleasure, not material joys. Vestal activities are a restraint
on the practice of love, which only begins when the vestal chooses
his or her first lover.
I have said nothing about the situations which give love free rein
and which provide such a powerful contrast with the vile intrigues
of marriage, and the odious calculations by which the first union is
so debased in our Civilisation. I have therefore given you no idea
•

There are five meals in the combined order: the marina! at 5 o'clock, breakfast at
8 o'clock, dinner at 1 o'clock, tea at 6 o'clock, and supper at 9 o'clock; there are
also two interludes, or snacks, at about 10 and 4 o'clock. This multiplicity of meals
is necessary to satisfy the ravenous appetite that everybody will have in the new
order, because of being constantly on the move. Children brought up to that way
of life will develop iron constitutions, their appetite returning every two or three
hours as a result of rapid digestion, due to the delicacy of the dishes they eat and
the art of mixing them j udiciously. This art, in which they will have been trained
since infancy, contravenes all our principles of sobriety, yet it will be one of the
seeds of the material perfection that will raise the human race to an average height
of 7 feet and an average life expectancy of 144 years. In this perfect state healthy
human beings will need to consume a twelfth of their own body-weight in food
every day. Even today there are more astounding appetites than this: in France
there is a person known as the man-carnivore who eats 14 pounds of raw meat at
a single sitting, not to mention his drinks and other meals. He thus consumes
some 20 pounds of food a day, yet weighs nothing like 240 pounds. As the Creator
has everywhere had to produce inverted designs of the combined order, he has
used the example of the tapeworm to represent the prodigious appetites of individ­
uals brought up in the new order.

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
of what love is like in the combined order. Yet the minor details I
have touched on will already have been enough to let you see how
the new order will open the way to love affairs of such splendour
and variety that all Civilisation's tales of love will evoke nothing
but pity. I would have been able to demonstrate this very quickly
if I had talked about the amorous Series and the relations between
the various groups assigned to the various characters of love. But
since I want to appeal to the reason rather than just arousing
enthusiasm, I shall not describe them: they would create a much
more vivid impression than I want.
I have satisfied the wishes of a number of people who asked me
for a short account of the combined order, just a page or so of
details, however incomplete. If anybody suspects me of exaggeration
in these glimpses into the pleasures of the future, they should
remember that I am talking here about the eighth social period,
which is very far removed indeed from the fifth, in which we now
are. I could have taken account of the weakness of the passions in
Civilisation and depicted, as I did in the first account, only the
more bourgeois pleasures of the sixth and seventh periods, which
we have to pass through if we are to succeed in reaching the com­
bined order.
By reassuring impartial readers that there is no exaggeration, I
do not expect to check the muttering of the multitude, which will
burst out in mockery of this second account. I admit myself that
the description must seem unbelievable until readers have experi­
enced it: even if it were presented with mathematical proofs and
other supporting evidence, people would still tend to doubt it until
they had personal experience of it. As Boileau said:
Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. 5

What could be truer than the opinion of Christopher Columbus,
with whom I like to compare myself? He announced the material
new world: I announce the social new world. Like him I express a
truth which seems stranger than fiction to those with prejudiced
eyes. Like him, I shall be accused of fantasy, because people will
want to assess the results I describe by using the means currently
available. They will prefer to believe that the social mechanism is
5 L 'Art poetique, Chant III, 48.
1 79

The Theory of the Four Movements
limited to the feeble resources provided by Civilisation, forgetting
that all these social miracles will be worked by progressive Series and
not by incoherent families which have the opposite qualities.
But as irony is the chief pleasure of the civilised, let them hasten
to express their malignity: as agricultural association could be given
a trial within six months, the impossibles will not have much time
to find fault, and the more eloquent their criticism, the more pitiful
they will look when they have to retract it all. Then people will
recall their sarcastic comments and take no notice of their uncon­
vincing words of praise, thus reducing them to silence. This is the
best punishment for curs like these who arc so rabidly opposed to
all new discoveries, people whom La Fontaine has so accurately
called
Minds of the lowest order
Who, being good for nothing themselves, try to savage everybody
else. 6

Nonetheless, their manic response may seem excusable, given the
way society has so often been taken in by the inexact sciences. We
should not be surprised if the moderns, after all the hoaxes of the
sophists, tend to be increasingly distrustful, nor that there should
be such a fondness for irony in Civilisation today, as everybody is
tired of having new philosophical theories advertised every day
which arc incompatible with experience and nature. But these
absurd sciences are approaching their end . Politics and ethics have
already annihilated each other in the revolutions of the eighteenth
century: a commercial science has survived them, namely political
economy, but it will not be long before that ends even more shame­
fully than the moralists it has crushed. [I shall review their recipro­
cal stupidities, and provide a glimpse of the outcome which awaits
the victor as it awaited the victim.]

On the abandonment of moral philosophy
Civilised nations, you are about to take a giant step forward in the
social world. By passing directly into universal harmony you are
escaping twenty revolutions which could bathe the world in blood
for another twenty centuries before the theory of the destinies was
discovered. You will be jumping two thousand years of social pro­
gress, something you will find no equal of in the history of preju­
dices. Reject the ideas of mediocrity and the moderate desires that
impotent philosophy whispers to you. Now that you are going to
enjoy the benefit of the divine laws, imagine the prospect of a happi­
ness as immense as the wisdom of the God who has shaped its
design. Look at the universe which he has arranged so magnifi­
cently, at the millions of worlds he has set rotating in harmony,
and you will recognise that so great a being could never be rec­
onciled with mediocrity and philosophy, and that it would be an
insult to him to expect moderate pleasures in a social order he had
created.
Moralists, what purpose can you have in recommending third­
rate incomes? Those who are fortunate enough to be above the
average will never want to come down to that level. No argument
will persuade a man with an income of 1 00,000 francs to give 80,000
of it away in order to reduce himself to a modest 20,000 francs
because it is the aurea mediocritas; conversely, those whose incomes
are only average have no intention of being satisfied with them, and
are quite j ustified in believing that they do not bring real happiness,
as long as the rich refuse to come down to their level despite the
ease with which that could be done. It is thus quite clear that aver-

The Theory of the Four Movements
age, modest incomes hold no attraction for the two classes who can
enjoy them, and it is absurd to advise them to do so because they
have experienced them, and they all agree that wealth is to be pre­
ferred. As for those who are below the average, it is quite wrong
to recommend it to them as they would have great difficulty reach­
ing it. People who are badly off are more likely to decline and fail
than to improve their fortune. Politics has already been the object
of the bitterest criticism for not being able to provide people with
necessities, so it is obviously pointless to set about encouraging
them with a taste for the average, when they cannot even be guaran­
teed their less exalted lot.
Theology sings the praises of poverty as the path to eternal for­
tune. Politics praises the riches of this world while waiting for those
of the next: both suit the human heart, which does not readily adapt
to mediocrity. The only reason for you moralists to have preached
the virtues of mediocrity was because of your obsession with saying
something new rather than echoing the dicta of religion and politics;
with the former preaching poverty and the latter so enthusiastic
about wealth, mediocrity and averageness are all you had left to
take up.
This is the danger of taking on a role which the others have
scorned. By its praise of mediocrity alone your · science stands
accused of ineptitude or charlatanry. If the praise is sincere, it is
inept; if you really believe that mediocrity can fulfil man's desires,
that it can allay his perpetual anxiety, then you do not understand
man, and you should go back to school yourselves instead of giving
us lessons. And if the praise is merely oratorical trickery, it is illogi­
cal to recommend mediocrity so highly when those who can enjoy
it do not like it, and when you do not know how to provide it for
those who have not got it. Whichever of the two you choose, it
reduces your dogmas to something well below mediocrity.
Do you think the question of intention will save you? That pro­
viding man with consolations will validate your efforts? If you had
any sincere intention of consoling the unfortunate you would look
for other means than your dogmas, which by your own admission
have proved powerless. Witness a modern moralist who says of the
masters of the art, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, 'To sustain me in
misfortune you give me the staff of philosophy, and say: walk stead-

1 82

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
ily, go through the world begging your bread, and you will be just
as happy as we are in our castles, with our wives and the respect
of our neighbours. But the principal thing I lack is the very reason
which you want me to use as my support. All your fine dialectics
disappear when they are most needed; they are like a reed in the
hands of a sick man, etc.'7
Moral philosophy is thus discredited by its own authors, but in
fact their own actions should have been enough to disabuse us,
without waiting for their disavowals. Ask the virtuous Seneca why
he sings the praises of poverty at the same time as accumulating a
personal fortune of 80 million pounds (current value) : no doubt he
thought poverty and mediocrity better in prospect than in reality,
like badly finished statues that only look good when viewed from
a distance. We might come round to Seneca's way of seeing things
if, like him, we could consign poverty and mediocrity to dusty
libraries.
As both your actions and your admissions attest to the power­
lessness of your knowledge to deliver the help it promises, what
should we take your intentions to be if you persist in dispensing
this useless aid? It is surely ironic for you to want to habituate us
to deprivation when what we are asking you for is real wealth and
real pleasure. You philosophers have more practised minds and
senses than most people, and are thus more acutely aware of the
pleasures of wealth: are you not absolutely delighted to learn that
the collapse of your systems is going to bring you the sort of fortune
you long for, even while you pretend to despise it?
Do not be afraid to confess your errors in full: the disgrace will
be borne by all scholars collectively, not by any one group in par­
ticular. Do you think doctors and writers will be able to avoid their
share of the blame? Have they not, like you, enough rationality and
good sense to perceive and criticise the general absurdity? Yes, the
absurdity is general as long as you are unable to remedy the most
scandalous social disorder, poverty. As long as poverty continues,

The Theory of the Four Movements
all your profound sciences are no more than certificates of your
insanity and uselessness. For all your wisdom, you are no more
than a legion of madmen.
You claim to be interpreters of reason. Remain silent, then,
as long as the civilised order lasts, for it is incompatible with
reason to recommend both truth and moderation. Where has
Civilisation made progress? In cities like Athens, Paris and
London, where men have never had anything to do with moder­
ation or with truth, but have been enslaved by their passions
and devoted to sensual luxury and intrigue. And where has
Civilisation declined and remained mired in mediocrity? In Sparta
and primitive Rome where the passions of sensual pleasure and
luxury were scarcely developed at all. After that, can there be
any doubt that the civilised order is incompatible with reason,
when you say the latter's purpose is to moderate the passions?
Can there be any doubt that this kind of reason must be banished
if the civilised order is to continue and progress?
Your science enjoyed something of a vogue in antiquity, but the
reason for this was that it indulged the passions; there was little to
fuel the imagination and curiosity in that period, when literature
and the sciences were still in their infancy. People thus became
very enthusiastic about dogmas which opened the way to so much
controversy and intrigue, and hypothetical philosophy was sustained
by its union with the established sciences and with religion. Pythag­
oras, the doyen of ethics, was also a skilled geometrician and a
respected prelate. He founded a monastery where he worked mir­
acles like bringing the dead back to life and similar pranks. His
followers were subjected to the harshest conditions, as Trappists
are today. So if moralists won popular favour, it was because in
mythological religion they formed an accessory to the priesthood,
like monks in the catholic church.
While the strict moralists of ancient philosophy seduced the
people by practising austerity and studying the useful sciences,
other, more accommodating Series [like that of Epicurus] won the
support of high society and formed cabbalistic coteries, over which
the idle rich of Greece would take sides, in the same way as their
equivalents in Paris today develop enthusiasms for some theatre or
actor. It must therefore be clear that this ancient Greek vogue for
ethics was based on nothing but the superstition of the poor and

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
the idleness of the rich; that is, on luck favouring the passions, not
on the influence of reason.
Different periods have different customs, though, and the ethical
coteries were no longer fashionable among the Romans; Cato, talk­
ing about an intrigue which had involved several Greek sophists,
expressed a wish to have all philosophers driven out of Rome, proof
that there was no longer the odour of sanctity about them.
And moral philosophy has only reappeared among the moderns
in order to die a natural death. At first it slavishly followed in the
footsteps of the ancients, re-hashing their diatribes against the pas­
sions and wealth, but in vain since what once amused Athens no
longer amuses Paris and London. The speculative sciences are like
fashion: they only last a certain length of time. The coterie of moral­
ists is all but extinct; cut off from religion and the exact sciences it
scarcely dares to show itself except by masquerading in fashionable
terminology like the analytical methods it still relies on to venture a
few meaningless words on the passions and launch a feeble dart in
their direction, like old men in the chimney-corner muttering
against the current century which no longer recognises them.
Although moral philosophy accuses our century of perversity for
being indifferent to its charms, it is easy to demonstrate that its
abandonment is the only rational act this century can boast; it is an
odd fact that the places where the writings of its adherents have
been most widely taught are those where they have been least fol­
lowed. Sparta and Rome are often cited as centres of ethics, but
Sparta had hardly any moralists, indeed did not even want to put
up with Diogenes, the great advocate of poverty; there were even
fewer moralists in Rome, when Cincinnatus had his radishes
cooked. Men were no better for being poor: their display of austerity
was just a product of circumstances. In Rome, as elsewhere, the
growth of wealth provided more refined forms of ambition: the
more developed Civilisation becomes, the less respect there is for
austerity and moderation. Philosophy's attempts to reinstate these
political pruderies are simply an indication of their unsuitability.
The more ethical theories a people accumulates, the less likely they
are to follow their precepts. The moralist coterie is the child of
luxury: by inveighing against luxury it repudiates its own father.
The number of volumes and systems it produces increases as luxury
progresses, and if luxury comes to an end, it takes ethical theories

The Theory of the Four Movements
with it, without the ruined nation becoming any better. The pre­
sent-day Greeks, for example, who have no philosophers, are no
more advanced in their customs than their classical predecessors;
ethical controversy stems from, and is sustained by, luxury alone.
When luxury rules it can gain credence as a romantic vision, amuse­
ment for the idle, so long as it is appropriate to the circumstances.
Far from being able to moderate the passions, it is reduced to
flattering the dominant vices for fear of being ignored entirely: it
has thus become much milder in tone in order to deal with the
moderns, who no longer respect radishes.
Morality is under a serious delusion if it thinks it has any auton­
omous existence. It is clearly superfluous and powerless in the social
mechanism, as whenever a matter arises that ought to fall within its
domain, such as theft or adultery, etc., the action appropriate to the
established order is easily determined by reference to politics or
religion. As for instituting reforms in manners or custom, if religion
and politics have failed, ethics will fail even more badly. Its only
role in the body of the systematic knowledge is to be the fifth wheel
on a cart, impotence in action. Wherever it combats vice alone you
can be sure of its defeat. It is like a bad regiment which allows itself
to be beaten in all its encounters and ought to be ignominiously
dispersed. That is the treatment the rest of the sciences ought to
give to ethics for all the services it has done them.
Politics and theology may have shown some respect for you mor­
alists from time to time, and allowed you to join with them in the
struggle against vice, but this is only so that they can leave you to
bear the shame of defeat while all the benefit of their corruption
accrues to them. For them, you are merely
The servile instrument
Cast scornfully aside when not of use
And coldly smashed when it grows dangerous.

Look at the way they treated you at decisive moments of history,
like St Bartholomew's Day and the French Revolution. If you doubt
their contempt for your tenets, try to find the opposite views to
theirs and you will have an idea of your importance.
An incident which occurred during the seventeenth century has
provided you with a final revelation of these disturbing truths.
There was a split in philosophy which gave rise to the new science
1 86

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
of political and commercial economy. The rapid progress it made
should have forewarned you of the triumph of ideas friendly to
luxury and the downfall of the moralists.
They realised very late that political economy was taking over the
whole domain of charlatanism. From the mid-eighteenth century all
minds rallied to this new science which announced itself as a dis­
penser of wealth and promised nations huge riches, in which every­
body flattered themselves they would share. The economists had
already usurped the field when the moralists were still struggling
away, singing the praises of poverty. When the French Revolution
finally dispelled all their illusions about republican virtues, they
tried to reach a compromise by putting forward ambiguous ideas
like being indifferent to wealth, neither loving nor hating it; very amus­
ing ideas, but with no hope of saving the ethical coterie. The econ­
omists were by now powerful enough not to need allies and rejected
all moves towards compromise, arguing instead that we needed
greater and greater wealth, with a vast trade in a multiplicity of mer­
chandise. From then on the moralists sank into obscurity and their
work has been ruthlessly reclassified as fiction. Their sect died with
the eighteenth century; it is politically dead and no longer has any
credibility among scholars and scientists, especially in France,
where it no longer figures in the academies.
The ethical coterie has died a natural, and edifying, death. They
ended up like those atheists who decide at the last moment that they
do believe in God. When they realised that they were irretrievably
defeated they admitted what they had been denying for 2,300 years.
They recognised that wisdom and an income of 1 00,000 ecus go
very well together, as can be seen in the poem about the countryman
who practises wisdom in a fine chateau, with his hounds and hunts­
men, cards and suppers where corks are popped for virtue's sake.
This is indisputably the sort of wisdom that can win converts, as
I shall explain in the third part when I talk about freemasonry.
Moreover the writers grasped the situation too late to give a
rational colouring to ethics: it would have been like sending
reinforcements to somewhere that had already capitulated. And
anyway by its last-minute confession that one can be wiser in a
chiiteau than in rags, that science showed only how inadequate it
is to lead us to wisdom and happiness. We can reach those goals
under the auspices of politics and theology, the only bodies of

The Theory of the Four Movements
knowledge which provide chateaux for their favourites: there is not
even the most minor position to be gained by enlisting under the
flag of ethics.
Just as a defeated army regroups in scattered bands which con­
tinue to infest the countryside for months afterwards, the remnants
of the ethical coterie form groups which march around without
order, system or purpose. Like drowning men they clutch at any­
thing, at metaphysics, at commerce, at any novelty. They are liter­
ary bandits who infest the high road of knowledge and try to inter­
vene wherever they are not wanted . They rack their brains to find
some safe haven for their exiled science; you listen to their pitiful
mutterings about morality, rather as you smile at distant thunder
after a storm. They are just busybodies: no reign could be more
conclusively finished than theirs.
There are no depths to which they will not sink in their attempt
to regain the approval of the passions they have insulted for so
many centuries. On this issue, let me quote the words of another
writer, lest I should be accused of vilifying a science fallen upon
hard times. 'It has become much more humane. Gentler, more
indulgent, it teaches compliance rather than combat. The art of
satisfying and sustaining the passions, reviving them when they fail,
finding new tastes when they die completely, these are the principal
aims of its lessons. ' ( Gazette de France, 1 7 January 1 808).
Returned to their senses by their disgrace, they behave like
dethroned princes who acknowledge too late their inability to
govern. But assuming that Civilisation could prolong its life, do you
believe that the economists who have eclipsed the ethical sects are
firmly ensconced on the throne of public opinion? No, these ephem­
eral sciences attack each other like revolutionary parties. In the third
part I shall demonstrate that political economy is already heading
towards ruin, and that the downfall of the moralists prepared the
way for the fall of their rivals. One might apply Danton's words
on the scaffold to these literary groups: when he had been fastened
with one strap he said to the executioner, 'Keep the other one for
Robespierre, he'll soon be following me. ' The moralists might simi­
larly say, as they are sacrificed by their executioner, public opinion,
'Keep the other strap for the economists, they'll soon be following
us. '

1 88

Second part: The private or domestic destinies
If ever Civilisation ought to blush at its scientific aberrations and
its capacity to be taken in by charlatanism it should do so today,
as it tramples under foot the tenets it has revered for thousands
of years and as the philosophical sciences grovel before passionate
attraction, which they previously wanted to repress, correct and mod­
erate. One of the two sciences, political economy, arouses a love of
wealth, while the other, ethics, allows you not to hate it, summoning
its dying voice to make honourable amends to the passions. The
human mind thus has the capacity to feed for thousands of years
on sophisms which in the end make it blush with embarassment;
how, then, do you civilised nations know that your modern visions,
your economic dreams, are not even more ridiculous, and will not
bring down more contempt upon the nineteenth century than the
ethical visions which you are ashamed of today? Do you think you
are coming closer to truth and nature by deifying commerce, which
is the constant exercise of lying and trickery? Do you not think
God may have imagined some honest and equitable method of man­
aging the exchange which lies at the heart of the social mechanism?
It is this that I shall be talking about in the third section of this
prospectus.
Meanwhile let me remind you that it is not enough merely to
acknowledge the authority of nature, whose sovereign influence you
admit. It is not enough to repudiate moral philosophy and its claims
to change the passions: in order to reingratiate yourself with nature
you must study her decrees in passionate attraction, which is her
interpreter. You make a great show of your theories of metaphysics:
what good are they if you scorn to study attraction, which is what
governs your souls and your passions? Your metaphysicians lose
themselves in the minutiae of ideology. But what on earth does
all this scientific twaddle matter? I who know nothing about the
mechanism of ideas, I who have never read Locke or Condillac,
have I not got enough ideas to discover the entire system of univer­
sal movement, which it has taken you 2, 500 years of scientific effort
to discover one quarter ot?
I am not claiming that my perspectives are vast because they
extend to points yours have never reached: I have done what thou­
sands of others were able to do before me, but I have had only one
end in view and I have worked with no established method and no

1 89

The Theory of the Four Movements
beaten track to show the way. Alone, I have confounded twenty
centuries of political imbecility, and it is to me alone that present
and future generations will owe the initiation of their immense hap­
piness. Before me, humanity wasted several thousand years in a
foolish struggle against nature; I am the first to have bent the knee
before her, by studying attraction, the organ of her decrees. And
she has deigned to smile upon the only mortal to have idolised her,
and revealed all her treasures to me. As the possessor of the book
of destinies I have swept away political and moral darkness, and on
the ruins of the speculative sciences I raise the theory of Universal
Harmony.

Confirmation derived from the inadequacy of

problems that the civilised mechanism
presents
Preamble on systematic thoughtlessness

Aristotle, one of the most highly regarded of our sages, considered
his own understanding to be woefully slight. His motto was 'What
do I know?', which was probably the best thing he said. The mod­
erns are not much inclined to modesty of that sort; yet are they
wiser than Aristotle when it comes to social policy? No. The situ­
ation has not changed since classical times: there is still nothing to
be found but poverty, fraud and revolutions. And judging by the
storms that our modern philosophers have inflicted on the present
generation, there can hardly ever have been a century in which
Aristotle's motto was more needed.
They have all gone laughably wrong, because in every science
they have overlooked the fundamental question, the one that is the
pivot of the whole of that science. For example:
If they are concerned with industrial economy they neglect to
deal with association which is the basis of every economy.
If they are concerned with politics they neglect to say anything
about population, the right size of which is the basis of a
people's well-being.

The Theory of the Four Movements
If they are concerned with government and administration they
neglect to look at ways of organising the administrative unity
of the globe, without which there can be neither a settled
order nor a guarantee of the future of empires.
If they are concerned with [practical] industry they neglect to
look for ways of suppressing [fraud], monopoly and specu­
lation, which amount to robbery of proprietors and are a
direct obstacle to circulation.
If they are concerned with ethics they neglect to acknowledge
and demand the rights of the weaker sex, the oppression of
which destroys the very foundation of justice.
If they are concerned with the rights of man they neglect to
include the right to work which, admittedly, is not admissible
in Civilisation, but without which all the other rights are
useless.
If they are concerned with metaphysics, they neglect to study
the system of God 's relations with man and to seek the means
of revelation God may use in respect of us.
The philosophers therefore possess the bizarre quality of over­
looking the fundamental problems of every science. This is system­
atic thoughtlessness as it regularly affects the most important ques­
tions. I could explain the cause of this incompetence, but if they
are as skilled in analytical methods as they claim to be they should
try to work it out for themselves.
Argument

Until the laws of social movement have been published, I can only
clothe this advertisement in negative proofs, such as the incapacities
of our scholars to deal with the problems of the civilised mechan­
ism. The Third part will therefore be purely critical.
I shall provide three demonstrations of the incompetence of the
moderns, citing their most recent oversights, ones which the present
generation will regard as very serious.
These three demonstrations will be taken from :
1.
2.
3.

Freemasonry.
Insular Monopoly.
Commercial Licence.

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
The first issue, freemasonry, will be presented in terms of the means
of salvation it offered to the sophists. As we shall see, this society
offered them a path by which they could make good their defeat
in 1 79 3 and regain fortune and respect. They were unable to take
advantage of it, however; and if they were so blind to the means
of influence available to their own ambitions, it is scarcely likely
that they will be more clear-sighted when it comes to serving the
human race.
Far from it, in fact, as they deprived humanity of opportunities
that could have opened the way to social amelioration, notably the
island monopoly and the commercial spirit.
In proving this assertion I shall have occasion to contradict all
the systems of modern politics, especially the prejudices about com­
mercial freedom, which can only be harmful since it is propagated
by the philosophers. It is here that we shall see how blind they are,
and realise that by trusting thinkers so hostile to the most obvious
facts, the human race was hastening towards new calamities.

First demonstration: Freemasonry and its
still unknown properties
God is the enemy of uniformity: he intends movement to be in
perpetual change, whether in ascendance or descent. To this end
God periodically" brings to fruition in our societies seeds of bene­
ficial or harmful innovations; it is up to reason to decide how to
use these seeds and to stifle the bad ones, such as political dubs,
or develop the good, like freemasonry.
What positive elements can we take from freemasonry? This is
an entirely novel question for a century that was incapable of per­
ceiving the opportunities this institution offered. Yet in rejecting it
we are scorning a diamond, not recognising its worth, just as the
savages of Guanahani 1 trod lumps of gold underfoot before Euro­
pean cupidity taught them its value.
Often, when we think we are merely enjoying ourselves, we are
involved in political processes of the highest importance: this was
the case with the clubs or casinos I have already mentioned, which
are an embryonic form of progressive household. This small inno­
vation could have overturned the civilised order if it had grown,
and if the clubs could have been brought to the point where they
became resident households for bachelors of different ages and with dif­
fering amounts of wealth. The members of such households would

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
soon have realised that the passions tend to subdivide all societies
into a number of unequal, rival groups, and after various attempts
they would gradually have succeeded in forming a nine-group tribe,
in which the rivalries would be balanced and harmonised. When
unmarried women saw the attractiveness of such a household, they
would quickly have imitated it, and the civilised order would soon
have disappeared without any political upheavals, and to the great
astonishment of everybody.
It could have been possible, with the help of freemasonry, to
bring about a slower and less spectacular revolution, but one that
would still have been very beneficial; the fact that modern scientists
did not notice this simply shows how their vaunted reason always
loses itself in the clouds before grinding to a halt in the compro­
mises of common sense. In their attempts to imitate the eagle's
disdain of gnats they lost the ability to grasp the processes of nature,
which are always extremely simple.
From the middle of the eighteenth century onwards, they aspired
to bring about a revolution of any kind in order to improve their
own fortunes. They succeeded in that; but as there were a number
of paths to choose between, it may be useful to show what other
steps they could have taken which would have benefited both them­
selves and the human race. I shall explain.
Before 1 789 there was great enthusiasm for spiritual innovation,
and circumstances were more propitious for the development of a
religious sect than they had been for Mahomet or Luther. The spirit
of the century called for a sect which promoted sensual pleasure,
but the philosophers never dreamed of founding one, not even in
1 795 when everybody was absolutely free to found new religions,
however dull.
After the defeat they experienced in 1 793 they had no choice but
to abandon a course that was no longer practicable, repudiate their
own teachings and side unreservedly with nature and the voluptu­
ous passions which, as they cannot be fought, must in the end be
tolerated.
But it was no easy step for these thinkers to enthuse about the
passions they had so strongly decried, so they fudged and side­
stepped the issue by proposing to ignore wealth, neither loving it
nor hating it. Great evils, however, require sweeping remedies. The
philosophers' only hope lay in taking a desperate decision. Crushed
1 95

The Theory of the Four Movements
by Civilisation, they should have attacked it at its weak point,
amorous servitude; and to destroy it, they needed to create a religion
of love, with themselves as its priests and pontiffs. Masonic societies
offered the means, if only they could have taken them over and
controlled them.
In this move to a sacerdotal position the philosophers would only
have been returning to their origins, for in antiquity they were acol­
ytes of mythological religion. I have said that the ancient moralists
were nothing but pagan monks: the Cynics and Epicureans were an
earlier version of the Capuchins and Bernardines, as the passions
develop in the same way in every society, merely taking different
forms.
What the philosophers lacked to launch them on a religious
course was a defector from the dominant religion, a leader like
Mirabeau who could destroy his own organisation. The moralists
could not attempt such a task on their own as all they had was a
facility with words, without either boldness or inventiveness. They
needed a leader who could guide them and give them the plan of
attack they were unable to imagine for themselves. So in the event
they just attacked the catholic religion without having any other
form of worship to put in its place.
Yet they had long had before their eyes the instrument that could
have ensured their victory, namely the sect of Freemasons. This
body, founded ostensibly for charitable purposes, had already over­
come the most difficult obstacles to forming a pleasure-loving,
religious sect.

It had succeeded m orgamsmg a network o f societies in all
civilised regions, with a membership drawn only from the well­
off classes, under the protection of the great men who led it.
People were used t o its mysterious meetings being held i n secret,
away from the uninitiated mass, and were not jealous of it.
It gave a religious gloss to sensual pleasure. What after all do
masonic meetings come down to? They are just picnics with a
few moral affectations to take the place of card games and pass
the time more economically. These customary feasts politely dis­
couraged the avaricious, who are more harm than use in religious
matters.

Here, then, was a grouping whose already existing organisation lent
itself marvellously to the foundation of a new religion. All it wanted

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
was a politically skilled leader who could introduce women and sen­
sual pleasure, and it would immediately have become the dominant
religion for the wealthy in all the empires of Civilisation, while
christianity, whose austerity makes it better suited to the people,
would be imperceptibly limited to them, like the cult of Fo2 in
China, which is restricted to the lower classes.
I shall not go into any detail about the regulations of the new
sect, or the means by which it would rapidly have drawn in all the
most eminent members of society, without detaching them from
the catholic religion.
Having been in such a favourable position for so long, the free­
masons must have been blind not to have been able to take advan­
tage of it. After that, if they do indeed, as they claim, have a secret,
it certainly is not the secret of going forward. The political insig­
nificance in which they have remained, when they had so many
opportunities of advancement, gives such a poor opinion of their
so-called secret that, even if they offered to share it, most people
would refuse to listen .
Will they perhaps say that they never wanted to rise higher than
political mediocrity? Or do they think that the leaders of a member­
ship organisation can guarantee them against the spirit of usurpation
which has always been the essence of such bodies from the janissaries
to the Jesuits? If these are the sorts of explanation they offer for their
circumspection, they are likely to be believed as little as the fox who
decided the grapes were too sour because they were out of his reach.
Meanwhile we can share one fact with the freemasons to console
them for their political ineptitude, which is that the shame of having
had absolutely no insight into matters of social movement puts their
society on the same level as the cleverest groups of thinkers in

Civilisation.

The religion of pleasure would have fitted very well with modern
philosophy: its desiccated economic systems, with their crude
propaganda for the love of wealth, needed an association with a
religious sect in order to give their arid precepts some soul. Political
economy needed an attractive mask to hide its ugly features: it is a
science that appeals only to the pocket, and it needed an ally that
appealed to the heart, a sect which by converting the enjoyment of
luxury and sensual pleasure to religious processes would have
2

I.e. Buddhism.
1 97

The Theory of the Four Movements
shown that a love of wealth and pleasure is quite compatible with
honesty, charity and the noble passions. Ah! surely it is better to
cover cupidity with flowers than to utter pointless denunciations of
it and sling mud at it, given that it is going to govern civilised man
for ever, with reason powerless to weaken its hold for an instant.
Note, though, that when I speak of a religion of sensual pleasure,
I take it to be applicable in principle only to the polite and wealthy
classes, then to a few adepts drawn from the people to serve the
sect, which could not encompass the initiation of the lower bour­
geoisie before it was solidly established among the upper classes.
This religion would have taken an opposite approach to that of the
austere cults, which have to take root among the people before they
extend to the higher classes, which today are slaves of the people in
matters of religion, not the least among the absurdities of modern
Civilisation.
By presenting the new religion as a relaxation for the upper ech­
elons of society, the freemasons could have enrolled the whole of the
opulent classes at the outset. The great are enthusiasts for anything
tending to the free enjoyment of sensual pleasure: how could they
not have enjoyed the refined exercise of pleasure in sophisticated
religious sects composed entirely of adepts of their own sort, both
men and women?
When the middle classes, the petty bourgeoisie, saw the new sect
so well received by their superiors, they would have accepted it
without a second thought, as they accept freemasonry today, by an
effect of the spirit of sects and proselytism, which is a natural part of
everybody's make-up. They would thus have been assured of
attracting them by making use of the lure of sensual pleasures, joined
with the spirit ofsects and proselytism: such would have been the plan
of the new religion.
There would be no point in raising objections to this account,
such as that I have not explained the means by which this would
all be done. There were infallible ways of capturing all the most
distinguished members of society, particularly the rich women who
are the mainstay of any religion. Among other sources of support,
this religion would have had the whole class of old people who, by
practising the new religion, would have found favour with the
young who today scornfully reject them when it comes to matters
of sensual pleasure. Civilisation, which has rightly been called a war
1 98

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
of the rich against the poor, is also a war of the old against the young,
and I shall show that the both groups lose by this disharmony,
which would have disappeared among the initiates of the religion
of pleasure.
But instead of adopting this plan, what approach did the philo­
sophers adopt in their attack on the Catholic religion, when they so
ineptly launched themselves at it head-on without understanding
how it would resist or having any means of countering its resistance?
This is where they revealed their real mediocrity, for the human
mind has never created anything more mediocre than the two
religions philosophy gave birth to at the end of the eighteenth cen­
tury, the Cult of Reason and Theophilanthropy. These were truly
pitiable religions, dead before they were even born.
Telum imbelle sine ictu.

No religion has ever begun in more favourable circumstances
than the cult of reason. There were no obstacles in its way; France
was terrified, and would have blindly accepted whatever religions
or constitutions were presented to it. This was an unheard-of
advantage for a new religion, to be able to establish itself at the first
attempt in a great empire, and to be able to force friends and enem­
ies alike to take part in its rites. Such a religion had only to adapt
itself to the spirit either of the people or of the upper classes and
it was bound to succeed simply by the test of time, an opportunity
which no civil or religious administrator had enjoyed since
Lycurgus. The philosophers' 'reason' must indeed have been
incompatible with the human heart not to have done well in such
a favourable situation. If you gave any other innovators the same
advantage, the test of time, they would invent a religion that people
would die for after a year's experience of it. But it would be a
passionate religion, not one based on moderation.
Theophilanthropy appeared under the most favourable auspices,
but it was still mediocrity and moderation in a new guise, and was
quite incapable of harmonising with the human heart. It could be
said of these two religions that one was a body without a soul and
the other a soul without a body.
The first was a lot of talk without any dogma, while the second
was spiritual insipidity without pomp; of the two, the first was per­
haps more political in conception, but it bemused the people by its
1 99

·

The Theory of the Pour Movements
ludicrous mixture of sacred and profane. It had its gods, like Marat
and Chalier, and its devils, like Pitt and Coburg, and it appealed
to the senses through civic parades and harmonious hymns inter­
spersed with political diatribes. It was a religion for the eyes and
ears, appropriate to people who wanted to be guided by their senses
and revere some material object, like the goddess of Reason.
The theophilanthropists proclaimed an invisible God who could
not be visually represented; the more reasonable their dogmas, the
more absurd their religious policy became. The people need to be
dazzled, not enlightened . Instead of your oracles of reason they want
visions of Apocalypse, miracles and mysteries, to provide nourish­
ment and support for their feeble intelligence. In short, they want
a religion that inspires them with enthusiasm to get rid of tiresome
reason, which reduces them to despair by revealing the full extent
of their social and domestic misery.
Both religions committed an entirely new blunder in having no
priests: the people want to see men entrusted with the proxy powers
of God. But the theophilanthropists frequently chose a lawyer or a
merchant to proclaim the word of God, and nobody likes to see
men like that preaching virtue. It was in vain for them to rely on
the title of paterfamilias: the greatest rogues and fools on earth could
lay claim to that. Besides, can ministers of religion be in church
and in their shop at the same time? Do they think a religion can
survive if it has no full-time priests?
The philosophers demonstrated their mediocrity by creating
religions of moderation, whereas an ignorant Arab, Mahomet, cre­
ated an enormously successful religion by being immoderate in
everything and employing nothing but excess, exaggeration and
monstrosity. What a slap in the face for the friends of moderation!
If they wanted to attack the catholic religion, they should have
opposed it by one which provided contrary excesses: it sanctifies
hardship, so they should have sanctified sensual pleasure. This was
a new course, unforeseen by Mahomet, whose religion is not in
the least pleasure-loving; it promises some pleasures to men alone,
without providing them for women; it fails to erect them into
religious practices; and it stunts their development by allowing
harems, which are the tomb of love, and which are the sole province
of the rich. In Civilisation, by contrast, any presentable young man

200

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
can form a harem from among the women of his town, without
incurring the additional expense of supporting them.
So I repeat there was a great coup to be made in religion, but
nothing great will come of moderation. b Moreover, the philosophers
should not be surprised that I do not go into the details of the
religious course that lay open to them, and which they failed to see,
because my intention is not to point out the errors in their science,
which will end when Civilisation does, but to make them see that
their philosophy was neither able to make headway by itself, nor
to save itself by creating a new religion. They enjoyed some influ­
ence in antiquity as adjuncts of the priesthood, but they saw their
credibility decline as the coming of catholicism led to the isolation
of the priesthood, who were too austere to associate with a literary
sect. They ought therefore to have returned to the only path to
eminence they had known, and manoeuvred themselves once more
into an association with the priesthood, or else replaced it with a
new religion of their own. They attempted this without understand­
ing how to do it, without recognising that there had to be a religion
of sensual pleasure, the foundations for which were already pro­
vided by freemasonry. Such a religion would have opened the way
to the sixth and seventh periods, as it would have led to amorous
freedom which would soon have extended from masonic organis­
ations to the whole of Civilisation.
Scholars are now beginning to say that love is not a crime: a
book on the subject has, apparently, appeared; but this is merely
to tell us what every fifteen-year-old schoolboy knows. The need
was to find means of leading society into the free exercise of love,
' There are only two or three moderate religions in the world, the Qµakers, the
Anabaptists, etc. What role have they played? Are they not also still-born, political
abortions? What does their moderation lead to, anyway? They say that the Quakers,
for all their restraint in dress, are far from restrained when it comes to gourmandis­
ing and cupidity, particularly in Philadelphia. One might therefore say, a propos
of their dreary clothes, 'Chase the passions out of the door and they will come
back in through the window. ' And might there not be a degree of self-interest in
their plain costume masquerade? You can be certain that there is always some
devilry hiding b e hi nd a facade of moderation; by wearing grey dress with no but­
tons the Quakers are exempt from taxes, military service, conscription, etc. In
return for that, how many of the inhabitants of France would become Quakers?
Fathers in order not to pay, sons in order not to leave home: what is the merit
of moderation if it procures advantages on that scale?

The Theory of the Four Movements
to foresee the social order which would develop from this, and to
reveal the future benefits of this innovation, which could easily have
been restricted at first to organisations separate from the mass of
the people, like freemasonry. It is thus one of the seeds that provi­
dence has sown amongst us in order to give us ways of salvation
and steps towards the combined order; and the fact that this federal
organisation was able to continue so long without its properties and
its destination being recognised by its leaders or by the philosophers
shows that it deserves to be ranked with the many other monuments
which in the future will bear witness to the shameful nature of
civilised politics.

Second demonstration: The insular
monopoly and its still unknown properties
I shall now explain the relation of the insular monopoly to God's
designs. It may be predicted that the views of the Creator on this point
will not be in agreement with the opinions of civilised men who, in
matters of politics, have always vegetated, scarcely raising themselves
from insignificance to mediocrity. They might as well have stayed at
the bottom of the ladder as drag themselves one rung above it.
In centuries more religious than our own it was rightly thought
that God sometimes punished nations; and if ever this opinion was
plausible it is today, when the whole of humanity is persecuted and
degraded by a single scourge, the island monopoly that ravages
every aspect of the social world.
It destroys industry at its base by closing the lines of
communication.
It attacks humanity en masse by financing and sustaining wars
that force peoples to tear each other apart.
It degrades sovereigns by making them slaves to a subsidy that
neutralises their political systems.
It outrages honour by subordinating the whole social mechanism
to cheap mercantile calculations.
Such are the depths to which our economic sciences have brought
us: the insular monopoly has re-opened Pandora's box, and the mul­
titude of calamities which have come from it should have been
recognised as a punishment from the supreme being, except that our
metaphysical subtleties have habituated the moderns to doubting
providence and degrading God by lacklustre arguments about his
203

The Tlze01y of the Four Movements
existence, and by a half-hearted belief that is just as impertinent as
atheism.
As long as peoples lived in a brutish or half-civilised state neigh­
bouring on barbarism, and while they were too ignorant to devote
themselves to seeking out God's intentions, their social incapacities
and rages aroused God's pity rather than his indignation, and no
scourge was sent to strike them all and subject them to relentless
torture in the way monopoly does today.
But the moment scientific progress, particularly nautical science,
allowed man to see that he was destined for higher things, and from
the moment reason became capable of studying God's wishes in the
calculus of passionate attraction, it became necessary for God to
visit humiliation on us whenever foolish pride blinded us to our
social incompetence and the absurdity of Civilisation. It was in
order to confound this foul society that God condemned it to give
birth, as it progressed, to the instrument of its own punishment and
dishonour, insular monopofy.
But God's actions are restricted to the attainment of a single
purpose; and the scourge that he has unleashed on the moderns
fulfils the dual function of humiliating their scientific charlatans and
offering the social world a means of regeneration which I am going
to describe. The acts of piracy and brigandage on the part of the
island which is desolating the globe are both a punishment from
God and a blessing, an arrangement in which the wisest providence
shines out. As you will see, this monopoly opens up several different
ways to social unity, none of which have been noticed because the
mercantile systems of the philosophers have narrowed everybody's
minds on the subject, and they have aggravated humanity's misfor­
tunes by abusing the means that God has given us to put an end to
them .
The modern policy of monopoly has been managed as badly as
it has been combated. England, which has undertaken it, has not
grasped the theory of it, and has been unable to take any of the
opportunities it has had to enslave the globe. It has only been able
to demonstrate the plan, without developing the means to put it
into operation . The same ignorance has ruled among her rivals, the
French .
The insular monopoly, despite the vileness of the methods it
employs, is still more sensible than the most equitable of the sys204

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
terns of Civilisation, because it tends towards the only praiseworthy
purpose in politics, namely the administrative unity of the globe.
In this sense, monopoly is a tiresome remedy administered to the
globe by God, and one which could rapidly lead to a happy out­
come, a transition to the sixth period. But the incompetence of the
English aggressors, and of the economists who have directed the
resistance to them from the continent, has taken monopoly in the
slowest and most devastating direction. This blindness on the part
of both nations should come as no surprise, since England and
France, the centres respectively of attack and resistance, are also the
two principal seats of philosophy in the world. They were thus
bound to outdo each other in ineptness, to take the most tortuous
routes and fan the quarrel to greater and greater heights, without
ever achieving an outcome.
The study of monopoly presents features worthy of attention,
both in its origins and in the various forms of development it can
take politically. Let us look at its origins.
God carefully prepared the way for monopoly by situating large
islands in the most frequented seas and at the points where it is
easiest to obstruct communications between countries. It can
quickly be seen that England, Madagascar, Japan, the two Sunda
Islands, New Guinea, Borneo, the West Indies, and all the great
archipelagos lie at the most important points of passage. God has
placed none along the vast 3,000-league coast that borders the
Pacific Ocean. No great rivers issue there and its seas cannot become
routes of general communication, so any large island placed in those
waters would have had no opportunity of developing a monopoly.
God therefore did not create any large islands off that coast, nor
even medium-sized ones like Ceylon or Newfoundland, Heinan or
Formosa, which are destined to become federal annexes of
monopoly.
When these great island landmasses, which can support 1 5 or 20
million inhabitants, become self-regulating and united under a
single prince, they have no other recourse but to commercial
invasion [or crude Monopoly] to attain the domination which every
empire seeks, to a gTeater or lesser degree. They are thus seeds of
monopoly which God has sown around the continents to obstruct
communications wherever industry and nautical science develop.
Sooner or later the West Indies will play this role for which England
205

The Theory of the Four Movements
has given the signal. The West Indies and the Bahamas, with their
ability to support 1 5 million inhabitants and their controlling pos­
ition at the mouths of great rivers, will, when they unite, form a
second mercantile canker before the advent of the third, which will
be formed by Japan. The invasion of China by the Russians will
soon force the Japanese, for their own survival, to develop nautical
science, in which they will be completely successful, and having
thus formed a rampart against the Russians they will use it as a
means of aggression against the industry of the world.
Since it is clear that God designed the rule of monopoly by scat­
tering the great archipelagos at favourable points, we need to exam­
ine what relation such a persecution can have to God's plan.
The tyranny of a handful of merchants over all sovereigns and
empires cannot, of course, be God's ultimate design: that requires no
further demonstration. What then were his motives in preparing this
monstrous influence of a few islands over the continental powers? To
provide a twofold means of confounding civilised politics.
By bringing it into ridicule, if the monopoly is badly man­
aged, either in aggression or in resistance.
2nd . To destroy it by a transition to the sixth period, if the monopoly is well managed, either in aggression or in resistance.
1 st.

Unfortunately for the globe it is the former that has prevailed, and it
is all too obvious that monopoly has upset modern politics. Leaving
aside the efforts of France, which may weaken under subsequent
rulers, we see the continental sovereigns giving way one after another
and subjecting themselves to a common enemy which is invisible and
inaccessible to everybody, which takes advantage of the rivalries of
each empire and the passions of each prince in order to set them
against each other and weaken them. It mocks their understanding
and their blindness alike, for the increase in subsidy always seduces
some of the weakest princes into taking up arms against their neigh­
bours; peoples are then victims equally of their sovereigns' wisdom
and their corruption, and their sovereigns are forced into war,
whether in defence of their honour or because of their venality.
Insular monopoly [in its crude form] thus has the monstrous
property of neutralising vice and virtue, of achieving its ends by
using both the wisdom and the lunacy of its rivals. God could not
have chosen a more ingenious punishment for humiliating kings
206

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
and peoples, civilised and barbarous, than by enslaving them to a
mercantile league in a far more shameful servitude than mere con­
quest. Insular monopoly subjugates peoples without allowing them
any defence; even the strongest coalitions do not enable them to
attack it directly, and if victories remove a few allies, its gold soon
provides it with new ones, so that it sets about spreading its influ­
ence and stirring up the continent just as it has stopped being over­
whelmed by force of arms.
For a full understanding of the influence of insular monopoly on
Civilisation we need to look at periods when the continent's oppo­
sition to it was led by mediocre princes, as in 1 789. At the present
moment, England is being thwarted and obstructed on the conti­
nent, but its repression is only temporary; France will not always
have a ruler ofsuch outstanding greatness. Political calculations cannot
be based on the chance of heroic deeds: one can only speculate
about ordinary ones, remembering that for every heroic prince there
are seven mediocre ones. England, therefore, could (although this
will soon be of no significance, as all political struggles will end with
Civilisation) - but England could regain its former position as a
result of some incident that weakened France, and plunge the conti­
nent once again into the intrigues of the monopolists . They have
continuity in their favour, and the steadfastness of their design,
whereas the continent, even in its attempts at resistance, may choose
the wrong means and exhaust its strength in vain efforts because of
the methods of resistance it adopts.
There is one means of resistance which is still not recognised,
which I shall call passive resistance. This can bring about the death
of the spider by depriving it of flies, by excluding from the continents
all commodities deriving directly or indirectly from the mono­
polists. This measure has been considered in theory, but nobody
has known how to put it into practice. When I say that it consists
in establishing the commercial order of the 6th period, this means that
I can only explain it in a special treatise devoted to the 6th period.
This new order is so easy to organise that a small state like Ragusa
can implant it and it will inevitably spread across the whole of the
globe, foiling all the monopolists, great and small. (For they are of
all sizes: does Denmark not have the monopoly of the little island
of St Thomas? What it does in one corner of the earth, it would do
over the whole globe, if it could.)
207

The Theory of the Four Movements
Until now, the continentals have only understood active resistance,
the maritime struggle, to support which they have recently formed
a federal league. This is a vast plan, and I have no doubt that the
great man who has adopted it could bring it to a successful con­
clusion. But it has one drawback within the system of federal resist­
ance, in that it requires a titanic hero to undertake it and see it
through. The operation may be jeopardised under less accomplished
successors, while monopoly continues towards its goal, however
inadequate the methods of its leaders. The perseverance shown by
the English cabinet in its plans may seem astonishing, but the
reason why they continue unchanged from one minister to the next
is that they flatter the passions of the greedy men who make up the
great majority, being based on pillage masquerading as the public
good, and ensure that every minister receives private wealth, popu­
lar favour and fame, without needing to have any talent. The so­
called talent of English politicians lies merely in their possession of
the magic wand of subsidy, which has the power to seduce rulers,
even against their will . Thus in the the last campaign but one we
saw Austria trembling at the sight of the abyss towards which it
was being pushed: it predicted its misfortunes and went knowingly
towards ruin, in order to succumb to the irresistible charm of sub­
sidy, like a bird unable to escape from a snake, which hesitates,
wails and flutters from one branch to another, and finally into the
mouth of the reptile which has cast its spell over it.
The English monopolists have directed their aggression as badly
as the resistance to them has been organised. They had to choose
between two courses of action :

Active aggression or ravaging the continent: England's choice of
this measure has made its catastrophic effects too familiar
everywhere for it to need describing.
Passive aggression or lulling the continent: this is the most brilli­
ant manoeuvre that civilised politics is capable of. It consists
of using the continent to effect its own conquest, using bar­
barism and Civilisation to seduce, pacify and subject each
other. England could have done this at half the expense it
cost them to ravage the nations and make them weaken each
other.
In the passive attack, the islanders have to envisage monopoly as
an auxiliary agent instead of as their political aim, and use subsidies
208

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
and other means of corruption for the single purpose of extracting
continental militias and forming them into two armies. One of these
would have gone into operation against the Barbarians in Persia,
India, China, Siam, etc., and the other would have been deployed
on the continent to maintain peace, raise militias for the conquest
of the barbarians, and lull the inhabitants of Civilisation by giving
them a share of the riches levied from the barbarians.
I shall not pause here to explain how such a plan could have been
executed: it was practicable throughout the eighteenth century, even
when France had a strong navy, because of the ease with which a
venal and lethargic cabinet, like the Versailles cabinet, could be
paralysed. By giving the German powers an interest in the English
plan, France could have been left to collapse on its own, leaving
its eighty ships to rot in port, while the English vessels exploited
Asia. The warriors of Europe would all have sought out the service
of a nation that provided them with the means of enriching them­
selves in Asia, and when the people of the continent saw soldiers
returning from their distant expeditions laden with riches, they
would have admired a system which aimed at pacifying Europe in
order to enrich it with the spoils of the globe. After that, England,
fortified with the respect and the armies of the continent, would have
gone on almost unhindered to universal conquest.
The prospect of its progress and the recognition of its designs
would not have aroused the opposition of any enemies. Cabinets,
like ordinary people, are seldom affected by anything but direct and
local danger, the fear of neighbouring states against whom national­
istic hatreds are directed. This is why England alienates very few
minds on the continent, even when it publicly proclaims its inten­
tion of weakening countries by setting them against each other. It
would thus have been very easy for it to command the support of
public opinion by adopting and revealing its plan of lulling the
continent, and only mounting operations against those who would
have disturbed the peace needed for raising armies! England would
have won over the ministers of every court, because they would
have been able to link corruption with honour and disguise their
venality beneath a mask of peace and philanthropy. They would
have pretended to regard the provision of armies as a guarantee of
civilised peace, even of the peace of barbarism, since the barbarians,
after all, would be better off with a steady government than under
the yoke of their pashas and nabobs. And by co-operating with such
209

The Theory of the Four Movements
a plan, civilised men would have achieved domestic peace and with
it the little well-being that Civilisation can attain to; a well-being
which would have increased when England reached the point where
it could remove its mask, reveal its supremacy and give the whole
globe a regulated form of organisation which would have led
towards the 6th period.
By following that course, the English monopolists would have
played the part of tutelary angels, mediators between Civilisation
and barbarism; they would have put into operation the finest plan
that civilised politics allows; and out of a system of pillage would
have arisen results more dazzling than the conquerors' spoils and
the · knowledge of the philosophers, for no bellicose or scientific
efforts can ever extend to even a quarter of . the globe, either by
conquest or by spreading enlightenment. No thinkers or heroes
have ever conceived (until the French federal system) any measure
which could be applied to the entire globe; whereas monopoly,
which has been so harshly criticised because so poorly understood,
could, in skilful hands, lead to the conquest, the unity and the
happiness of the world.
This was the path open to England if it could only have identified
with the continent instead of remaining isolated and treating it as
an enemy, if it could have used the continent's forces to enlarge its
own instead of absorbing them in mercenary wars. This nation must
have very little political genius for all its ministers in turn to be so
fixed on the appalling system of continental destruction, without
looking for less odious ways of proceeding. But then, most English
ministers have been disciples of philosophy, which stifles all great,
noble and j ust ideas, which is why those so-called Statesmen have
only been able to harass mankind and lay waste the earth i nstead
of subjecting and organising it. They have stopped at small-scale
brigandage instead of going on to develop a plan for a general
offensive. All their finesse amounts to a few minor aspects of trade
and pillage; they govern as arithmeticians, not as politicians, and
their secrets - like the freemasons' - consist in not having any.
Yet England sustains its position by the consequences of the
multi-faceted good fortune that God has assigned to insular mono­
poly, whatever course it takes. Given that England has been able to
grow by random trading, always rejecting the better system, and
that, despite its incompetence, it has always been able to counteract
210

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
the most miraculous triumphs of its rivals, imagine what would
happen if Civilisation managed to continue, and other seats of mon­
opoly blossomed in different archipelagos and followed the English
plan of destruction rather than the lulling approach . For it is highly
probable that the West Indies, Japan and other Eastern islands
would rapidly imitate England, which on its own gives so much
trouble to civilised man and barbarians, despite being the weakest
of the great archipelagos that God created to punish and spur on
Civilisation by means of humiliation and suffering.
This glimpse of the opportunities facing monopoly should not
cause any anxiety, though, as Civilisation is approaching its end;
and as soon as progressive Series have been organised, every insular
power, even if it has a thousand rated ships, will be forced to give
them up to the federal monarch of the globe without a single sword
having to be drawn. But if we hypothesise the continuation of Civil­
isation, we shall see that insular monopoly, even in its most oppress­
ive form, is still a salutary punishment from God, because it neces­
sarily tends to dispel the philosophical torments and establish uni­
versal peace and the paramount unity of the globe. Indeed:
If the islanders follow the lulling approach I've described, they will
very rapidly achieve global conquest, and as soon as the world is sub­
ject to one of the archipelagos, whether England or another, we shall
see the insular sovereign become part ofthe continent. He will form the
globe into a hundred kingdoms, all vassals of one great empire in which he
will set up his residence, after which he will destroy the instrument of
his elevation, reducing to insignificance the conquering island that
served him as a stepping-stone, and use his navy to destroy the influ­
ence of the island navies, and at their expense consolidate the para­
mount unity he has set up, which is the government of the sixth
period . The globe will thus have found a direct and speedy means of
survival in a monopoly that adopts the lulling approach.
If the islanders follow the destructive plan that England has
adopted, which is as slow and odious as the other is swift and noble,
mankind may still find three different paths to survival which will
lead to unity, to wit:

The success of monopoly.
The impatience of sovereigns.
Continental federation.
2II

The Theory of the Four Movements
1 . The complete success of monopoly, becoming absolute master by
means of destruction or by the lulling approach, leads in either case
to continentalising the insular conqueror, forming the globe into small
kingdoms federated under a central empire, and thus to the subjec­
tion of the conqueror to the conquered, as China has more than
once absorbed and subjected invading Tartars.
This subjection of the victorious island by the defeated continent
is entirely comparable to those demagogic schemes where some mal­
content incites the populace to crush the rich and then, having
achieved power, sides with the landowners and muzzles the people.
In the struggle between the archipelago and the continent it is
surely clear that the archipelago plays the part of the insurgent
populace, and that, as a tool, it will be broken, as agitators always
break their tools, as soon as victory has been achieved.
2. The impatience of sovereigns. This could occur if some acts of
piracy, like the Copenhagen expedition,' finally made the kings
realise the imbecility of the political sciences and the degradation
into which they have led Civilisation. Then one sovereign, in a
moment of anger, might threaten to banish all the inexact philo­
sophers unless they discovered, within a year, a means of indirect
aggression against the monopoly whose progress their mercantile
systems have favoured. Faced with this threat, the frightened philo­
sophers would make a virtue out of necessity and would suspend
their quibbling while they tried to come up with some useful inven­
tions, and sooner or later they would discover one of the means
(for there are several) of defeating the insular monopoly without
striking a blow, by purely political processes which lead to the sixth
and seventh periods, and a unified government.
' England left such attacks rather late. They would have been fine during the period
when France was plunged into anarchy, when the continent had no rallying point
and no focus for resistance. Then the English, by using a degree of violence, could
have terrified the continent and utterly defeated it. But today, underhand actions
like the Copenhagen affair serve only to strengthen support on the continent for
the hero who can lead them out of mercantile servitude, and in this connection
the invasion of Zeeland and the pointless atrocities which accompanied it (like
filling bombs with ground glass) is actually a positive event, as it must eventually
reveal the need for a continental league. In my view, the whole continent, apart
fr?m the unfortunate city of Copenhagen, owes a vote of gratitude to those English
mm1sters who were clumsy enough to lift their mask by that disgusting act of
treachery. But anyway none of this matters, as we are about to leave Civilisation.

212

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
3. Continental federation. This third result is the one which has
prevailed, and which may lead to the submission of England and
the unity of the globe.
If the French federation covered the whole of Europe, rather
than the half it has already united, and if one could just co-ordinate
Europe around one centre of action and one combined plan of
resistance, all the world's ports would be closed to England within
a year. The powers of Asia, Africa and America would not be able
to oppose the wishes of a league of Europe supported by a million
troops. All that is necessary for the overthrow of the insular mono­
poly, therefore, is for a federal league to become established in
Europe. And the importance of this league would lie not in the
annihilation of the monopoly, which may always rise again from its
ashes as long as Civilisation continues, but in the establishment of
the governmental unity of the globe which constitutes entry into
the 6th period, and prevents any revival of monopoly. It remains
to be shown how this federal league of the globe should be organised
in order to achieve such a desirable aim .
In short, then, there are three means of unity and survival that
monopoly offers the globe, even through the disastrous system of
continental destruction that has prevailed as a result of the political
ignorance of the English. I was thus right to define insular mono­
poly as a tiresome but salutary remedy administered to the globe by
God, one which, at the risk of causing us a degree of torment, must
sooner or later lead to very happy results. Indeed:
The abuse of the remedy, or continental destruction, eventually
provokes one of three salutary occurrences I have described.
The judicious use of the remedy, or lulling the continent, leads
rapidly and smoothly to un iver s al uni ty
Finally, by one course or the other, monopoly brings about the
complete collapse of philosophy, because it can only be overcome
by procedures contrary to political and moral systems; it heaps ridi­
cule on all their maxims during its reign, which venalises all minds,
and by the degradation of those two sciences it leads to the blessing
of unity, the path to which the philosophers were always completely
incapable of discovering.
We may conclude from this that the insular monopoly, the target
of so much ignorant criticism, is a wise arrangement of God's to
.

213

The Theory of the Four Movements
confound our enlightenment and procure us a good that we do not
even dare to desire, the blessing of social unity, as monopoly leads
us to this end whichever path it takes. Indeed we would be there
already if the narrow-mindedness of our philosophers had not
stifled the idea and caused the best opportunities to be lost.
I shall restrict myself to mentioning one of them, the most recent
one to arise, from which it ought to have been possible to profit by
forcing England to yield up its fleet to the federated states of the
continent.
After the battle of Jena and the days which followed, in which
Prussian ruin was completed, only three powers were left in Europe:
France, Russia and Austria. Austria could have proposed a league
with France in the cause of unity, stipulating in return 1 00 million
subjects for the princes and friends of her house; and these two
powers together could easily have convinced Russia to co-operate
with them.3
No time has ever been more favourable for this operation, but
Austria was so absorbed by the old ideas of balance and equilibrium
that it probably never even glimpsed the magnificent course open
to it.
As an agreement between those two powers would have entailed
the adhesion of the whole continent, they would have proceeded
to execute the plan under the direction of the French monarch.
Consequently they would have sent out sufficient forces to occupy
the Caucasus and Himalayan regions and assemble all the hordes
of Asia on the Oxus. The wis.hes of the confederation of Civilisation
would then have been notified to the Asian sovereigns, with a threat
to change the dynasty and depose the functionaries of any empire
that offered to resist. After which a hundred federal kingdoms
would have been organised for the princes of Europe, with appro­
priate rank and fortune allotted to the great people of those regions,
who only need their harems and their pipes and who, having always
lived in a state of fear, will be very happy to have a settled existence
in a more stable order than barbarism.
Yet instead of pondering these beneficent operations of unity,
sovereigns persist in arguing endlessly over a few scraps of land,

214

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
when the globe provides them with vast empires to share in a way
which even benefits the peoples who inhabit them. This narrowness
of outlook of European politics is due to the influence of philosophy.
By ranting against the spirit of conquest it turns mankind away
from the one path to well-being compatible with the civilised order.
Can there be any lasting peace on the globe while Civilisation con­
tinues, unless a general conquest brings all peoples together under
one central government?
There is nothing more murderous than the moderation urged on
sovereigns, the only outcome of which is to make wars last for ever,
because there will always periodically be ambitious princes looking
to invade other countries until there is a superior power on earth
capable of guaranteeing general peace.
To sum up, then: since nautical science has given us the means
to travel the globe, there has been no more salutary passion than a
boundless ambition for conquest, because if one of the monarchs
alone succeeds in conquering two-thirds of Europe, he can force
the other third to range itself under his banner, and immediately
bring about the federal league of the world and universal
pacification.
Similarly, it is now clear that our theories of moderation, with
their advice to each prince to be content with the fortune that
chance has given him, are in fact theories of perpetual carnage, which
only tend to make wars last for ever, because they do not give
empires any guarantees against attacks from their neighbours, who
can tear up treaties with impunity.
The chance to organise federal unity was lost in 1 806, thanks to
Austria's apathy. A more splendid chance is offered today to the
united emperors of France and Russia. I do not know which of
those two monarchs is at present more able to flatter himself that
he has mastered fortune, but I do not think any mortal has ever
been in a better position than Alexander is today, with fortune offer­
ing him the opportunity to share in the fruits of Napoleon's labours
and j oining with him in the magnificent undertaking of the federal
unity of the globe.
And as insular monopoly tends in various ways towards the estab­
lishment of this unity, this superior authority which will be the
guarantor of universal peace, my claim that this monopoly is a viol­
ent but salutary remedy administered by God to the social world
215

The Theory of the Four Movements
is justified; despite the appalling practices the monopoly has
employed it is still a more sensible system than our philosophical
theories, which all favour permanent warfare, and concomitantly
favour the prolongation of the miseries of mankind, because they
have led the monopolists to the most disastrous system of
aggression, continental destruction, and the continentals to the most
wrong-headed system of resistance, active struggle or maritime
struggle, the absurdity of which will be evident from my explanation
of the means by which Civilisation can speedily put an end to all
monopoly by establishing the commercial order of the sixth period.

216

Interlude: System of development of
civilisation
I warned you that I would scatter a few chapters on the theory of
social movement through the course of this book: here is one which
is entertaining, but which also should be read twice, in order fully
to understand the movement of Civilisation, the progress and decay
of which are represented in the table on the next page.
By pointing out the opportunity for social progress provided by
insular monopoly and freemasonry, I have demonstrated the incom­
petence of modern politics, which have been incapable of profiting
by these means of improvement, these ways out of Civilisation.
The moderns are blinder still on the subject of the commercial
mechanism; an analysis of it will prove the philosophers' insistence
on stifling truth in all its forms and ignoring the most obvious
symptoms of our ignorance of the art of society.
The rule of the commercial spirit is represented here as a
degeneration or decadence of the civilised order, and the table of
the civilised m ech an i sm , which follows, indicates the positions held
by commerce and monopoly. I shall explain (in the 'Progressive
table of civilised movement') how progress and decadence are oper­
ated solely by natural forces, without the inexact sciences ever
having provided any assistance. Each phase has special attributes
which I shall not go into here.
Progress and decadence

The two phases of descending vibration affect the growth of collec­

The Apogee is the period when the sixteen characters of Civilis­
ation are fully developed and take the least vile forms; I do not say
the most noble because this society is always odious, its four phases
varying only in the detail of their constantly dominant treachery
and iniquity.
The table contains an apparent contradiction in that Civilisation
falls into decline with the development of nautical science, even
though it is at the heart of social progress: for an explanation, see
the definition of the word decline on page 93, where I show how
the social period can decline as its social capacities progress.
By the term nautical science, I mean large-scale navigation that
can extend to traversing and ruling the globe. This skill is the finest
achievement of the human mind, and is only suited to the sixth
and subsequent periods, not to Civilisation. When Civilisation rises
to such a degree of scientific understanding, it is only to its own
218

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
misfortune. It takes on more than it can handle; indeed, in our
hands nautical science produces insular monopoly, and other cala­
mities which could not occur in the sixth period, and this excess
of knowledge becomes harmful, in the same way that good food
can damage your health if you eat too much of it. The proper scope
for civilised abilities lies in small-scale navigation: large-scale navi­
gation should not have been organised until the sixth period,
because it gives rise to a host of social storms, which engender the
third and fourth phases, the period's decline and decay.
Each of the four phases of Civilisation has its moment of pleni­
tude or apogee, as does the period as a whole. It is clear that the
third phase is at its fullest, as we see the exclusive rule of insular
monopoly and all the catastrophes, like bankruptcy, speculation,
hoarding, etc., that stem from mercantile politics.
N .B. This abbreviated table of progressive movement has no con­
nection with mechanical movement, which would represent the
system of passionate counter-march in compound order, the sixteen
manoeuvres of character or developments of passions in inverse
order. It would indicate their systematic points of encounter and
separation, by collision, conflict and divergence. Then the diffrac­
tion of the seven primitives and their formation into recurrent
series; and finally the great pitched battle of the passions. I say great
battle because although the passions are constantly at odds with
each other in the five societies of isolated households, in Civilisation
the clash between them presents more costly and more complicated
manoeuvres than in any other period. The civilised mechanism is
thus the most . unpleasant political horror in the universe, as it is a
complete reversal of the combined order, which is the wisest of all
God's arrangements.
Note that in the three phases of Civilisation we have already been
through philosophy never co-operated with social progress, though
arrogating to itself whatever slight honours were due in that area.
It was always passive in regard to Social Movement; I have already
given some indications of this, which I shall assemble here.
rst phase. This arises when wives are granted civil rights. This
is what the ancient philosophers like Confucius and the philo­
sophers of Egypt and India never worried about, never showing the
least intention of ameliorating the position of women. Women then
had even less freedom than they do today, sharing none of the

The Theory of the Four Movements
various amorous rights, such as repudiation; and moralists, then as
now, were indifferent to their well-being.
wd phase. Civilisation enters this phase by the alleviation of slav­
ery. We have seen how this improvement was the effect of nobiliary
feudalism, which provided farming communities with the means of
collective and progressive emancipation. Attaching serfs to a glebe
rather than an individual turned the weaknesses of each seigneurial
lord to their advantage; and as the community was able to obtain
a concession here as a result of the father's avarice, and a concession
there out of the son's good nature, it gradually progressed towards
liberty. This was a process of which the ancient philosophers were
still totally ignorant.
3rd phase. This phase developed through the influence of com­
mercial politics, the origin of which lies in the colonial monopolies.
This influence was not in any way predicted by the philosophers,
nor have they found any way to counter-balance it, or even to attack
it in its most oppressive form, namely insular monopoly. Their only
engagement with commercial politics has been to preach vice
instead of combating it, as I shall demonstrate later.
4th phase. Civilisation reaches this point through the influence of
a limited number of qualified professionals who, protected by privilege,
exclude the best qualified applicants and restrict access to their jobs.
Such companies harbour the seed of a vast feudal coalition, which
would soon invade the whole financial and industrial system and
create industrial feudalism. The philosophers were very far from
foreseeing this, and while they were infatuated with the mercantile
spirit whose influence they so little predicted, the events were
already in preparation which would change that policy, and make
us descend to the fourth phase of Civilisation.
But these sophists are not interested in predicting future storms,
they only see social movement in retrograde, and only concern
themselves with the past and the present. Today when the mercan­
tile spirit is dominant they will decide, as they always do, that the
current state of things is the perfection of reason. They will only
hold forth on what they can see, without ever assuming that the
civilised order might take new forms.
And when Civilisation subsequently arrives at its fourth phase,
when commercial feudalism is fully established, the philosophers
will intervene after the event and form a new coterie of controversy
220

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
about it; we shall see them preaching the vices of the fourth phase,
and selling torrents of books on the new order, seeing it too as the
embodiment of the perfection of perfectibility, just as they regard
the mercantile spirit today.

Third demonstration : Commercial licence:
Its known vices and its unknown dangers
Introduction

Here we are dealing with the most tangible aspect of Civilisation,
where it is hard not to raise one's voice against the madness of the
present time and against the chimeras which are so fashionable.
To speak out today against the absurdities of commerce is to run
the risk of being anathematised, as if one had spoken out in the
twelfth century against the tyranny of the popes and the barons. In
fact if I had to choose between two dangerous roles, I think there
would be less risk of offending a sovereign with troublesome facts
than of offending the mercantile character which reigns despotically
over Civilisation and even over its sovereigns.
Nobody ever makes sound social judgements when they are in
the depths of an infatuation, as witness the commercial systems:
the slightest analysis will show that they deprave Civilisation and
disorganise it in every way, and that in matters of commerce, as in
everything else, they are going further and further astray under the
auspices of the inexact sciences.
The controversy over commerce has scarcely been going on for
half a century and its authors have already produced thousands of
volumes without realising that the mechanism of commerce is
organised against all common sense. All the essential classes - pro­
prietors, farmers, manufacturers, even the government - are con­
trolled by a secondary class, by merchants who ought to be their
inferiors, their commission agents, removable and responsible, and
yet who direct and obstruct at will all the resources of circulation.
222

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
This is the basis of my argument: I shall establish that in a good
political system the commercial body must be liable to itself and
underwritten by itself and that the body of society must be assured
against bankruptcies, speculation, hoarding, usury, waste and other
disorders which stem from the current system, a system which
ought long ago to have aroused the indignation of all political writ­
ers if they had a fraction of the respect for moral principle that
they lay such public claim to.
In this first memorandum I do not want to do more than broach
the subject, pointing out the scandals which bear witness to this
loss of direction, and which aroused me to discover a less criminal
mode of exchange than the current one, which they call free
competition.
Exchange, like every other relationship, has a procedure specially
assigned to each period, for example:
In the 4th period (or barbarism), forced sale, maximisations,
tariffs, etc.
In the 5th period (or Civilisation), free competition, indepen­
dence of the merchant.
In the 6th period (or guaranteeism), societary competition, soli­
darity and subordination of the commercial body to the
interests of the producers, manufacturers, farmers and
proprietors.
There are other procedures for different periods, which I do not
mention here as I only want to deal with the sixth, societary
competition, which is compatible with our practices, and which is
already preferable to free trade, which itself is preferable to
maximisations, tariffs and other customs of the fourth period or
barbarism.
I shall treat this debate from the point of view of Civilisation,
as if the laws of movement had not been discovered; let us forget
their discovery for a moment and let our thoughts proceed as if
their task was merely to look for a remedy to the commercial
disorders of Civilisation. Let us see what approach the econom­
ists, who claim some competence in commercial affairs, might
have adopted in this situation.
In the course of the discussion that follows I shall have occasion to
express unflattering opinions of commerce in general, but I have said
already that my criticism of a profession is not a criticism of the
22 3

individuals who follow it. Anyone who denounces the manoeuvrings
of market-riggers, lawyers or anybody else might well be even more
grasping ifhc were in their place; one should never blame the passions
of individuals, only Civilisation which offers no path but vice for the
satisfaction of the passions, and thus forces man to practise vices to
obtain wealth, without which there is no happiness.

Origin of political economy and the mercantile
controversy

Here is a topic really worthy of the period. Muse, tell us once
more of the exploits of those bold innovators who overthrew ancient
philosophy, the economists, a sect which suddenly arose out of
nowhere and dared to attack the revered dogmas of Greece and
Rome. The true models of virtue, the Cynics, the Peripatetics, all
the well-known lovers of poverty and mediocrity, are discomfited
and yield to the economists who fight for the cause of luxury.
Divine Plato, divine Seneca, are hounded from their thrones; the
black broth of the Spartans, Cincinnatus' radishes, Diogenes'
smock, the whole arsenal of the moralists is rendered powerless,
and all fly before the impious innovators who permit love of splen­
dour, good food and the basest metals, like gold and silver.
In vain have the Rousseaus and the Mablys bravely defended the
honour of Greece and Rome. In vain have they represented to the
nations the eternal truths of ethics, 'that poverty is a blessing, that
we must renounce riches and embrace philosophy without delay'.d
' These are the actual words of Seneca, the man worth 80 million . He wants everyone to get rid of their wealth instantly. He does not allow any delay. 'What are
you waiting for?' he asks, 'Don't put it off until tomorrow, abandon your riches
today and give yourself up to philosophy.'
This is the sort of trickery which has occupied civilisation for the last 2,000
22 4

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
Argument is futile! Nothing could stand in the way of the new
dogmas: the corrupt century breathes nothing but commercial treat­
ies and trade balances in sous and deniers. The colours of the Port­
ico and the Lyceum have been deserted for the academies of com­
merce and the societies of the friends of commerce. For the inexact
sciences, the invasion of the economists has been a second Pharsalia,
when the wisdom of Athens and Rome and the whole of antiquity
suffered an irreversible defeat.
Humanly speaking, Civilisation has changed phase, passing from
the second to the third, in which the spirit of commerce completely
dominates and rules politics. This change is brought about by the
progress of nautical science and the colonial monopolies. The phil­
osophers, whose interventions in social movement always come after
the event, ranged themselves with the century's general attitude and
started to promote the commercial spirit after they saw that it was
the dominant one, thus creating the sect of economists and the
mercantile controversy.
Why have the philosophers changed their minds after so many
centuries, and started to involve themselves in the commercial mat­
ters they used to scorn? They always used to ridicule commerce in
antiquity. All the writers used to make fun of merchants, saying
with Horace that the science of commerce boiled down to knowing
What is a hundred francs at five per cent? Five pounds!4

The influence of Tyre and Carthage showed that commercial power
was capable of overcoming agricultural power and influencing the
whole governmental system. But as this had not happened, it never
could happen. This is the pattern of philosophical judgements, which
only ever look at social movement retrospectively, such that future
generations will depict civilised politics with its head facing back­
wards, looking fixedly into the past.
years, the sort of rubbish which has passed for wisdom. Today we can recognise
the absurdity of the thinkers who advise us 'to throw our treacherous riches into
the depths of the greedy sea' 0.-B. Rousseau). Yet these phrasemongers are still
not the most absurd: there are more inept, and more culpable, play-actors in the
coterie of economists, whose assumption of a masque of rationality makes them
even more dangerous.

The Theory of the Fou r Movements
During the course of the eighteenth century, the inexact sciences
continued to retain the ancient bias that regarded commerce with
disdain, as witness the spirit that still ruled in France as late as
1 788. Disputes between scholars still sometimes contained scathing
references to opponents as tradesmen 's sons, and this was a cruel
insult. This was the opinion throughout the provinces: the mercan­
tile spirit was restricted to the ports and the capitals where the
major bankers and speculators lived . It was only in 1 789 that mer­
chants were transformed into demi-gods, and that the scientific
cabal openly took their side and exalted them as useful instruments
of their designs.
Commerce was thus originally despised and misunderstood by the
philosophers [who even today understand it so little that they confuse
it with the useful category of manufacture] . Commerce only won the
full approval of these thinkers when it was already completely victori­
ous, like doctors who are only spoken highly of once they appear in a
carriage and six: then orators start celebrating their virtues and dining
with them. This is how philosophy behaved towards the commercial
spirit, only trying to win its favour when it had achieved the pinnacle
of success, not deeming it worthy of attention thitherto. Spain, Portu­
gal, Holland and England exercised commercial monopolies for a long
time before philosophy thought of praising or censuring them.
Holland was able to amass vast riches without asking the economists
for help; indeed the Dutch had accumulated tons of gold before their
sect was even created, while the philosophers were still rummaging
about in antiquity, or interfering in religious quarrels.
Finally, they realised that this new politics of commerce and
monopoly could provide material for quantities of large books and
accreditation for a new coterie; at that point philosophy gave birth
to the sects of economists who, despite their recent origins, have
already amassed hundreds of volumes and look likely to equal the
number of books produced by their predecessors.
Like all sophists, these newcomers clouded the subject as much
as possible so as to fuel controversy and live at the expense of their
readers. It is true to say that far from discovering anything, the
economists still do not even know what they are talking about, for
on the most important questions, such as the limits to be set to popu­
lation, they admit that their science has no fixed theories. They there-

226

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
fore produce no definite results, and it is thus hard to see what
purpose they can serve. This however is of no consequence to the
authors: the presses groan, the books sell, and so the aim of philos­
ophy is fulfilled.
We might ask the economists whether their purpose is to dimin­
ish or to augment the political scourges, like increa�ed taxation,
encroaching chicanery, the growth of armies, more bankruptcy and
deceit, etc. There can be no doubt that all these scourges have
increased more rapidly than ever since the birth of economic theor­
ies. Would it not have been better for that science to have made
less progress, and thus for less harm to be done?
What interests led the philosophers, those ardent apostles of
truth, to range themselves during the eighteenth century beneath
the banner of lies, that is to say, of commerce? For what is com­
merce but lies, with its paraphernalia of bankruptcy, crooked specu­
lation, usury and every other sort of deceitfulness? Modern philo­
sophy ignores all these scandals: let us point out the causes of this
effrontery, and apply to these thinkers' conduct the analytic
methods they want to apply to everything else.
When they decided to extol the virtues of commerce, the only
issues they took into account were what things meant in terms of
gold: the size of mercantile fortunes and the speed at which they
were amassed; the independence of the merchant's position, which
is the freest and the one that gives most scope to ambition; the air
of lofty speculation which covers the lowest schemes the worst dull­
ard can think up and organise within a month (if somebody will
teach him, for nobody learns anything in commerce); and finally the
ostentation of the j obbers and hoarders who rival the highest in the
State in eminence: all this glamour dazzled the thinkers, who were
reduced to so much scheming and burning of midnight oil to gain
a few pence by producing some degrading tome or other. They
were stunned and disoriented by the sight of these commercial
plutocrats, and hesitated between servile flattery and criticism. In
the end, the weight of gold tipped the balance, and they became
the committed and humble servants of the merchants, and admirers
of the mercantile science they had once so fiercely ridiculed.
And how could they fail to admire those speculators who, as
Boileau put it,

22 7

The Theory of the Four Movements
Possessed the secret knowledge
That five and four make nine, take away two, leaves seven,' 5

those men who, armed with that knowledge, managed to acquire a
palace in the city in which they had arrived with only a few pence in
their pockets? They lead a life of splendour in the capitals alongside
poverty-stricken scholars and thinkers. The philosopher who is
invited to the house of a speculator finds himself seated between a
courtesan and an ambassador: what course can he take in that situ­
ation save to praise the leading lights of the day?
For nobody gets anywhere in Civilisation by telling the truth,
which is why, despite nursing a secret hatred of commerce, the
philosophers have bowed down before the golden calf, and dare not
write a page without sounding the praises of boundless commerce,
and commerce unbounded.
They had everything to gain from attacking it; they could have
regained respect and made up for their failures by denouncing the
pillage carried out in the name of commerce, which they secretly
despised as much as commerce despises them.
Analysis of this pillage will show that the body of merchants
(who are not to be confused with manufacturers) is no better than
a combination of pirates in the social order, a horde of vultures
devouring agricultural and manufacturing industry and enslaving
the whole body of society.
This is not to criticise them as individuals: they do not realise
the maleficence of their profession; and when they do recognise it,
it would be hard to blame anybody for robbery in Civilisation when
the whole of civilised society is an interplay of swindlers and vic­
tims, a fact which is already all too familiar, and of which new proof
will emerge in the chapters that follow.
Robbery of the social body by bankruptcy

When a crime happens frequently you get used to observing it
unemotionally. In Spain or Italy you see hired assassins coolly stab
their victim and then escape with impunity by taking refuge in a
church. In France and Germany, where the national character
abhors treachery, a murder like that would arouse so much horror
5

Boileau, Satire vm, 2 1 3-14.

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
that the assassin might well be torn to pieces by the crowd before
the forces of law and order could arrest him.
Often you find crimes that are common in one nation regarded with
horror in the neighbouring country. In Italy fathers mutilate and
murder their children in order to perfect their voices. The ministers
of the God of peace encourage these cruelties by taking these unfortu­
nate victims of paternal greed as altar boys: and there you have more
abominations to arouse the horror of every other civilised nation.
You will find similarly revolting customs among the French, the
Germans, the Russians and the English, which would stir up out­
rage among the Italians or the Spanish, such as the English custom
of leading a wife to market, with a rope round her neck, to put her
up for sale, and a number of other coarse customs of that nation,
more savage than civilised, like their habit of insulting and molest­
ing foreigners, who often receive more respect from savages than
from the inhabitants of London and the English provinces.
If customs and opinions differ so much from one nation to
another, how much greater must the difference be between societies!
The vices tolerated in Civilisation will seem extremely odious in
lass imperfect societies. In the sixth (Guaranteeism), which is still a
long way from perfection, people will find it hard to believe that
empires which claim to be organised and well-governed, and that
have theories about property and j ustice, could have tolerated
abominations like bankruptcy for a moment.
Bankruptcy is the most ingenious and most shameless form of
dishonesty that has ever existed, enabling every merchant confi­
dently to steal from the public a sum proportionate to his fortune
or his credit. So that a rich man might say to himself, 'I set up in
business in 1 808 and on the same day in 1 8 r n I shall steal so many

millions from whoever it may concern.'
Let us leave aside one current aspect, the new French Code, with
its promise to suppress bankruptcy, as opinions differ about this
hope and there already appear to be various ways of evading the
new laws, and wait to see what experience shows (if Civilisation
lasts long enough for that). Instead let us look for the time being at
what we know, the disorder caused by the philosophical system
and by the principle: 'Give merchants complete freedom, without
demanding any guarantee about the prudence, probity or solvency
of any of them. '
229

The Theory of the Four Movements
As well as to other abuses, this gives rise directly to bankruptcy,
a more despicable form of theft than highway robbery, yet one
which people have become used to and tolerant of; so much so that
they even regard some as honest bankruptcies, when the speculator
only takes half the total sum. Let me give you an example.
The banker Dorante, who is worth 2 million, wants 4 or 5
million, quickly, and by whatever means it takes. On the strength
of his fortune he obtains credit of eight million, in bills of exchange,
commodities, etc. He thus has rn million to work with. He goes in
for speculation, rigging the supply of commodities and government
stocks. At the end of the year, let us imagine that instead of doub­
ling the two million he started out with, he has lost it. You would
think he would be ruined, but he is not: far from it, he will have
the four million just as he would if his speculations had been suc­
cessful. He still has the 8 million he obtained on credit and, having
suffered an honest failure, he arranges to pay back half that sum over
the next few years. Thus, having lost his patrimony of 2 million,
he now has 4 million he has taken from the public. Commercial
freedom is a very fine thing! Now you realise why every day you
hear someone say of a merchant, 'He is very comfortably-off since
his business failed. '
Another stroke o f luck fo r the bankrupt i s that, after his theft of
4 million, Dorante continues to be held in great respect and public
esteem, not as a fortunate robber but as an unfortunate merchant.
Let us examine the explanation for this.
When he was premeditating his bankruptcy, Dorante courted
public opinion: his feats, both in town and in the country, won
him enthusiastic supporters; all the brilliant youth are for him, the
beautiful women all commiserate with him on his misfortune
(misfortune is the modern synonym for bankruptcy), and they all
praise the nobility of his character, so deserving of a better fate. To
listen to the apologists of a bankrupt you would think he was worse
off than those who have lost their fortunes to him. All the blame is
laid on political occurrences, disastrous circumstances, and other
forms of verbiage familiar to lawyers, who excel at withstanding the
attacks of angry creditors.
After the first onslaught Dorante brings in some mediators, a few
coins distributed in the right places, and soon public opinion has
been so successfully outwitted that anybody speaking against
230

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
Dorante is likely to be accused of cannibalism. In addition to this,
the people he persuaded to part with the largest sums of money are
mo or 200 leagues away, in Hamburg or Amsterdam. They will
calm down in time, and anyway it does not matter, as their distant
gossip will not have any effect in Paris. After all, Dorante only lost
half his money, and custom has decided that losing half is not so
much culpable as unfortunate. Thus, from the very outset, Dorante
is publicly whitewashed . After a month, public opinion will be dis­
tracted by other more sensational bankruptcies, with losses three or
four times greater. This adds new lustre to Dorante, who only took
half, and whose affair is now over and forgotten. His house gradu­
ally opens again for public hospitality, his cook wins people over
again, and confounds the complaints of the few atrabilious creditors
who have no respect for misfortune and do not understand the con­
sideration due to high society.
So fewer than six months sees the completion of the operation
by means of which Dorante and his like steal millions from the
public, ruin the families who have deposited money with them, and
drag honest merchants into bankruptcy that places them on the
same footing as crooks. Bankruptcy is the only social crime which
proceeds like an epidemic, bringing the same opprobrium down on
honest men as on knaves. An honest merchant who is subjected to
the bankruptcies of twenty crooks will finally be forced into insol­
vency like them.
That is how the dishonest bankrupts, who acount for nine-tenths
of the total, give themselves out to be men of probity who have had
misfortunes and proclaim in chorus that they are more sinned against
than sinning. To hear them, you would think they were all saints,
like convicted prisoners, who always claim they have never done
anything wrong.
The supporters of commercial licence will talk about repressive
laws and tribunals: yes indeed, tribunals against people who steal
several millions at a time.
The dictum that justice only nets the petty thieves is disproved
in commerce: bankrupts, even the smallest, evade the pursuit of
authority thanks to the protection of the merchants themselves.
That is the truth.
Scapin, a small shopkeeper, is declared bankrupt for 40,000
livres. He misappropriates 30,000 livres, which is to be his profit

The Theory of the Four Movements
from the operation. Then he presents his creditors with the r o,ooo
livres remaining. If they ask him to account for the missing 30,000,
he replies that he cannot keep accounts like rich merchants, and
that he has had misfortunes. You would imagine that Scapin would
be punished, as he is a petty thief who has embezzled 30,000 livres;
but the creditors do not realise that if they go to law the costs will
eat up the remaining r o,ooo livres, which is just small beer as far
as the courts are concerned . After the r o,ooo has been used up, and
no decision has been reached, they will have to disburse another
ro,ooo if they want to see Scapin hanged, and still have no certainty
of success. So it is more sensible to accept the modest sum of r o,ooo
livres than to pay out the same amount again. Scapin turns this to
his advantage by employing a lawyer, so that the bankrupt himself
is threatening his creditors with the law. And, anyway, why should
Scapin's creditors deal severely with him? Some will want to follow
his noble example, while others will already have preceded him in
the same course. Just as wolves do not eat each other, Scapin will
soon find a number of signatories to agree to his proposals. Others
will sign for fear of seeing the law involved and the money used
up; a few recalcitrants will speak of sacrificing everything for the
sake of seeing a rogue sentenced to penal servitude. Then Scapin
will send his wife and children to beg for mercy with practised
howls and wails, and thus in a matter of days Scapin and his lawyer
will obtain a majority of signatures, and will be able to laugh off the
few who still refuse because they no longer need them. Scapin
blithely responds to their anger with soft words and low bows; and
having seen the success of his first bankruptcy, is already contem­
plating a second.
It is pointless to cite the few fraudulent bankrupts who have been
punished: 99 out of every r oo are successful, and if the hundredth
fails, it is probably because he is a fool who could not manage to
conduct the scheme properly; for it is such a safe operation now­
adays that nobody bothers with the old precautions any more. Once
the bankrupt would flee to Trent, Liege or Carouge, but that
custom has been abandoned since the regeneration of 1 789. Every­
one has gone back to bankruptcy at home; they calmly make their
preparations, and when the affair breaks they spend a month in the
country with their family and friends, while the lawyer deals with
everything. After a few weeks they return, and the public is so used
232

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
to these escapades that everybody treats it good-naturedly. It is
called confinement, and they say coolly so and so has just come back
from his confinement.
I have said that bankruptcy is the only social crime that operates
like an epidemic, and forces honest men to behave like crooks. As
evidence of this I shall cite the example of sequential fire bankruptcy.
There are over a hundred different kinds of bankruptcy: such is the
perfection of reason under modern philosophy.
Sequential fire bankruptcy. The Jew Iscariot arrives in France with
1 00,000 livres' capital which he gained from his first bankruptcy.
He sets up as a merchant in a town where there are six rival com­
panies, all accredited and respected. To gain custom Iscariot begins
by selling all his goods at cost price, which is a sure way of attracting
the crowds. His rivals soon start shouting, but Iscariot smiles at
their complaints and continues happily giving away goods at cost
pnce.
The people think this is wonderful, and sing the praises of com­
petition, the Jews, philosophy and fraternity. Everything has come
down in price since Iscariot's arrival, and the public turn to the
rival companies and say, 'It is you, sirs, who are the real Jews, the
greedy ones. Iscariot is the only honest man among you, he is con­
tent with a small profit because he does not have a splendid house­
hold to maintain as you do.' It is in vain for the established mer­
chants to claim that Iscariot is a crook in disguise, and that sooner
or later he wilLgo bankrupt: the public accuse them of jealousy and
slander, and flock to Iscariot in ever-increasing numbers.
This is the thief's calculation: by selling at cost price all he stands
to lose is the interest on his funds, which amounts to perhaps 10,000
livres a year, but in its place he gains a substantial market, wins a
reputation in the ports as an important customer, and is granted a
great deal of credit as long as he is prompt with his payments. This
set-up continues for two years, at the end of which Iscariot has
gained nothing, but has sold a vast quantity of goods. Nobody
knows his method of working, because Jews only employ Jews, a
people who are the secret enemy of all nations, and who never reveal
a fraud planned by one of their number.
When everything is prepared for the final stroke, Iscariot brings
his full creditworthiness into play, gives large commissions in all
the ports and buys 5 00 to 600 thousand livres' worth of goods on
233

The Theory of the Four Movements
credit. He sends all the goods abroad and sells everything in his
warehouses at very low prices. When he has realised the latter,
honest Iscariot disappears with the money, and returns to Germany,
where he has sent all the goods he bought on credit. These he
rapidly sells, and finds himself four times richer on his return from
France than he was when he arrived there. With 400 thousand livres
to his name he sets out for Livorno or London to prepare a third
bankruptcy.
At this point the scales fall from people's eyes in the town where
he carried out his coup. They realise the danger of admitting Jews
into commerce, as they are vagabonds who care for nothing. But
Iscariot's bankruptcy is merely the first act of the farce: let us follow
its consequences and see the sequential fire.
There were six companies in competition with the Israelite: let
us call them A, B, C, D, E and F.
A had been in difficulties for some time, sustaining himself with­
out capital, living off his good name; but Iscariot's arrival having
removed his custom, he could only struggle on for a year, after
which he lost courage and, not having any idea of the new philo­
sophical systems that protect vagabonds, was forced to give way to
Iscariot's tactics and declare himself bankrupt.
B bore the attack for longer. He saw Iscariot's dishonesty a mile
off and prepared to wait until the storm passed before winning back
the custom stolen from him by the scheming Israelite; but in the
interval he was hit by a large bankruptcy elsewhere, and this was
enough to precipitate his downfall. He thought he would be able to
last out for two years, but after fifteen months he was forced to
declare himself bankrupt.
C was trading in association with a company in another town
which was ruined by another Iscariot (for there is one in every
town). C was caught up in his associate's collapse and, after eighteen
months of sacrifices in an attempt to sustain the Hebrew thief's
competition, C was forced to declare himself bankrupt.
D's probity was more apparent than real. He had the wherewithal
to continue, despite twenty months of competition from the Jew.
But angered by the losses he had sustained he slipped into the
corruption he saw so much of around him and, observing that his
three fellow-merchants had opened the way for him, realised that
he could be the fourth, whether his pretended misfortune was real
2 34

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
or fictional. After that, and fed up with his twenty-month battle
against Iscariot, he thought the most sensible thing to do would be
to declare himself bankrupt.
E had lent large sums of money to the four merchants who had
gone into insolvency, believing them to be financially sound, as
indeed they were before Iscariot's scheme took away their business.
The collapse of the four companies caught him unawares, in
addition to which he no longer had any customers as they had all
flocked to Iscariot who was selling goods at cost price. E found
himself without means, his credit exhausted, his creditors pressing
so, unable to meet his commitments, he ended up declaring himself
bankrupt.
Although F still had plenty of means, the collapse of the other
five led to his being refused credit in every port, as they suspected
that F would soon follow his fellow merchants. Moreover, some of
those who terminated their agreement with him started selling at
very low prices to meet prior contractual liabilities. Wanting to
speed up sales they lost a tenth and gained perhaps four-tenths,
having reconciled themselves to losing half the value. F is crushed
by this, and reduced like his fellows to declaring himself bankrupt.
That is how the establishment of one vagabond or one Jew is
enough completely to undermine the merchant body of a large
town, and involve the most honest of men in crime. For all bank­
ruptcy is criminal to a greater or lesser extent, however much it is
disguised under specious pretexts, like those in the examples I have
given. There is very little truth in any of the pretexts: what it comes
down to in the end is that each one skilfully seizes opportunities
to carry out a robbery which will go unpunished. If to bankruptcy
we add crooked speculation and the host of other disgraceful activi­
ties spawned by philosophical theories, there will be general agree­
ment with the opinion I put forward earlier, namely that civilised
man has never committed so much political folly as since the advent
of the commercial spirit and these systems which claim that every
mercantile enterprise must be contributing to the general good, and
that merchants must have total freedom, without any guarantee
being demanded about the results of their operations.
How did the philosophers, who think of nothing but counter­
balances and guarantees, fail to think about obtaining the kind of
guarantee for the social body that governments have the good sense
23 5

The Theory of the Four Movements
to demand from their fiscal agents? A prince assures himself of the
trustworthiness of his tax-collectors by means of securities and the
inevitable prospect of punishment if they dare risk or squander the
public funds they hold in trust.
Why do we not sec half the tax-collectors appropriate the sums
they have gathered and then write a pitiful letter to the government,
saying, 'The misfortunes of the time, critical circumstances, deplor­
able setbacks, etc . : in short, I am bankrupt, insolvent, or some other
word. Your coffers should contain IO million: I am offering to give
you half that, 5 million, payable in five years' time. Have pity on
the misfortune of a poor tax-collector, continue to trust me and
allow me the management of your coffers, without which I will not
even be able to pay the half that I am offering. If you allow me to
retain my position and continue to collect revenue I shall do all in
my power to honour my commitments, i.e. I shall regale you with
a second bankruptcy when the coffers are full up again. '
This, i n abridged form, i s what all letters from insolvents say.
The reason tax-collectors do not follow their example is that they
are well aware that no philosophical theory would be able to save
them from the punishment which bankrupts evade as a result of
the principle that merchants must be granted total freedom, with no
guarantees demanded against malpractice.
To sum up, then: the body of merchants being trustees of a
portion of the public wealth, and each merchant using the sums
entrusted to him to gamble on risky speculations with no regulation
apart from his own fancy, there are bound to be large numbers of
blunders and bankruptcies, as a result of which the producers and
depositors of capital have to suffer the losses of foolish enterprises
to which they never gave their consent. To obviate this injustice,
the commercial body should have to submit to a guarantee, such
that no merchant and no company of entrepreneurs could risk and
lose what they have.
There is an operation which achieves that end, which makes the
commercial body its own insurer and the social body insured against
commerce. Once this operation has been carried out, bankruptcy,
crooked speculation and discredit can no longer continue to exist.
Commerce will use at most a quarter of the agents and the capital
which they currently divert from productive labour. There is no
urgency to reveal what this operation is, as it is a sixth-period pro-

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
cedure, and one that is completely opposed to this absurd system
they call free competition.
Let us continue investigating these commercial scandals, and the
pillage that leads us to treat the whole of the present commercial
system with suspicion, and to look for a method of exchange that
is less corrupt than free competition, which would be better named
anarchic competition.
[I have only described three sorts of bankruptcy. In the Treatise,
I shall provide a list of forty-two sorts, but three is enough for a
prospectus.]
Robbery of the social body by hoarding
Gold gives even ugliness a tinge of beauty.

This maxim has never been more effectively demonstrated than by
the protection and respect that hoarders have gained under the aus­
pices of modern philosophy, which allows no basis for judgement
except the amount of gold involved, and which flatters all the domi­
nant vices in order to hide its ignorance and remedy it.
Hoarding is the most odious of all social crimes because it always
attacks the poorer sections of the workforce. If a shortage of basic
foodstuffs or any other commodity occurs, hoarders are always on
the lookout for ways of making the situation worse. They buy up
the existing provision, put a down payment on any new supplies
that are expected, take them out of circulation, then double or triple
the price by schemes that exaggerate the scarcity of the goods, and
spread fears that are only recognised as illusory when it is too late.
They have the same effect on the industrial body as a band of
executioners would have on a battlefield, if they went around hack­
ing and enlarging the wounds of the injured.
One factor that has contributed to the current favour enjoyed by
hoarders is that they were persecuted by the Jacobins, a struggle
from which they emerged more triumphant than ever, as anybody
who raised his voice against them immediately seemed to be echoing
the Jacobins. Nobody seems to realise that the Jacobins massacred
all kinds of people without distinction, whether they were honest
men or brigands. Did they not send Hebert and Malesherbes,
Chaumette and Lavoisier, to the same scaffold? And just because
2 37

The Theory of the Four Movements
these four men were sacrificed to the same faction, does it follow
that they should all be regarded as equally blameworthy, and that
we should think of Hebert and Chaumette as good men because
the Jacobins immolated them like Malesherbes and Lavoisier? The
same reasoning can be applied to crooked speculators and hoarders:
they may have been persecuted by the enemies of order, but they
are nonetheless destructive for that, vultures unleashed against
honest workers.
Despite this they have found supporters among the class of think­
ers called economists, and nothing is more highly regarded today
than the form of hoarding and market-rigging known in current
jargon as speculation and banking, it being indecent to call things by
their proper names.
One very bizarre consequence of the civilised order is that if you
directly suppress a group of obvious ill-doers, such as hoarders, the
evil grows worse and the goods get scarcer. This was quite convinc­
ingly demonstrated under the Terror. It is this that has led philo­
sophers to conclude that merchants must be left alone. A fine remedy
for an evil, that, to allow it to continue because nobody knows how
to stop it! They ought to have looked for an antidote and, until
such time as one was found, to have condemned their shady deal­
ings instead of extolling them. They needed to encourage the search
for a procedure capable of suppressing them (societary com­
petition).
And why do the philosophers make light of disasters such as
bankruptcy, market-rigging, hoarding, usury, etc.? Because public
opinion would say: 'We are aware of all the misfortunes you go on
about, but as you are scholars with more understanding than us,
use your energy to discover some remedy for them. So far your
science and rhetoric have been useless, like the wittering of a doctor
who recites Latin and Greek names to a sick man but does not
provide any relief for his symptoms.' Foreseeing this tiresome com­
pliment, the philosophers deem it sensible to confuse us about evil,
rather than admitting it, so they prove that hoarding and market­
rigging are the perfect form of the perfection of perfectibility. With
all their verbosity about analytic methods, metaphysical abstraction
and the perception of sensation giving rise to ideas, they plunge
you into a scientific lethargy and persuade you that everything in
the social order is for the best. Forced to make their living by selling

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
books, which they have to write on whatever subject they can, and
accustomed, like lawyers, to pleading bad cases as well as good, they
find it much easier to extol and disguise the dominant vices than
to spend all their time fruitlessly seeking for remedies when they
could be writing another book.
Thus it is that the er' .omists, including Adam Smith, have
praised hoarding as sometning that operates to the common good.
Let us analyse the achievements of these hoarders or speculators.
I shall give two examples, one on the hoarding of grain, which is
the most dangerous sort, and the other on the hoarding of materials,
which appears to be more excusable as it only damages industry,
instead of hitting the people directly.
1 . Hoarding of grain. The fundamental principle of commercial
systems, the principle of giving merchants totalfreedom, accords them
absolute ownership of the commodities they deal in. They have the
right to take them out of circulation, to hide them, even to burn
them, as the Dutch East India Company has done more than once,
publicly burning their stocks of cinnamon in order to raise its price.
What they did with cinnamon they would have done with wheat,
if they had not been afraid of the people's reaction. They would
have burned a portion of their wheat, or left it to rot, so that they
could sell the remainder at four times its value. Every day on the
docks you see them throwing supplies of grain into the water
because some merchant has left it to rot while he waited for the
price to go up . I myself, as a clerk, have presided over these des­
picable operations, one day throwing into the sea twenty thousand
quintals of rice, which could have been sold before it rotted for a
decent profit, if the owner had not been so greedy for gain. It is
the body of society who has to bear the cost of this wastage, which
happens day after day under the protection of the philosophical
principle of laissez-faire: let the merchants do whatever they like.
Imagine that a rich company of merchants, following this prin­
ciple, corners all the grain in a small state such as Ireland, in a
famine year like qo9, when the general scarcity and prohibitions
on exports from neighbouring states have made it practically
impossible to import grain from elsewhere. Imagine that the com­
pany, having bought up all the available stocks of grain, refuses to
release them at less than three or four times their cost, saying, 'This
grain is our property and we want to sell it for four times what we
2 39

The Theory of the Four Movements
paid for it. If you don't want to buy it on these terms, go and buy
it somewhere else. It may be that a quarter of the population will
die of hunger in the meantime, but we don't care about that. We
shall continue with our speculation, according to the principles of
commercial freedom, as enshrined in modem philosophy. '
I ask you what difference there i s between the actions o f this
company and those of a band of thieves, for its monopoly would
force the whole nation, on pain of death by starvation, to pay the
company a ransom equal to three times the value of the wheat it
provides.
When you consider that the company, according to the rules of
commercial freedom, has the right not to sell at any price, to leave
the wheat rotting in its granaries while the people perish, can you
believe that the starving nation is conscience bound to die of hunger
for the sake of the fine philosophical principle of laissez-faire? Of
course not. You must therefore agree that the right of commercial
freedom should be subject to restrictions in accordance with the
needs of society as a whole, and that any man possessing a super­
abundance of a commodity of which he is neither the producer nor
the consumer must be regarded as a conditional trustee, not its absol­
ute owner. And you must agree that the dealings of merchants and
middlemen must be subordinated to the good of the mass of society,
and not given free rein to impede the normal relations of exchange
by their calamitous manoeuvres, which your economists so much
admire.
Should merchants alone be exempt from the obligations to the
body of society that are imposed on so many other and more worthy
groups of people? When generals or judges or doctors are given
freedom to act, this does not mean that they are authorised to betray
the army, plunder the innocent or murder the sick. If they betray
their trust in that way they are punished: treacherous generals go
to the guillotine, whole courts are summoned before the Minister
of Justice - only merchants are inviolable and assured of impunity!
Political economy intends there to be absolutely no control over
their machinations. Let them reduce a whole region to starvation
or disrupt industry by cornering materials and by bankruptcies, it
is all justifiable because they are merchants. It is like the quack
doctor in the play who kills everybody with his pills but is able to
j ustify himself by pronouncing the phrase medicus sum . And now,

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
in this century of regeneration, they are trying to persuade us that
the conspiracies of the least enlightened group in society can never
operate to the detriment of the state's welfare. Once upon a time
it was the pope's infallibility that people tried to establish: now it
is the infallibility of merchants.
2. Hoarding of materials or commodities. I am going to demonstrate
the maleficence of this by means of an event unfolding before our
eyes as I write. This is the huge rise in the price of colonial goods,
sugar, coffee, cotton, etc. I shall be particularly concerned with
cotton because that has suffered the largest price-rise and because
it is the most urgent necessity of our new manufacturing industries,
which have developed during the last few years as a result of the
attention and encouragement of the emperor. What I shall say about
the present situation is applicable to hoarding of all kinds.
In the course of last autumn, people began to realise that consign­
ments of colonial goods, particularly cottons, were going to encoun­
ter difficulties, and that supplies would be delayed. There was no
reason, at first, to fear that the factories of France would suffer as
a result of this because there were sufficient stocks of cotton in the
warehouses at that time to provide for a year's consumption
(including purchases from abroad which were on their way to
France). If the government had taken an inventory it could have
made certain that the factories had enough supplies to last a year,
during which time steps could have been taken to guard against
future shortages. But the hoarders intervened, invaded and sealed
off the existing supplies, and let it be known that the manufacturers
would run out of materials in less than three months. Cotton then
rose to twice its normal price, a rise that threatens to wipe out most
of the French factories, which cannot raise the price of cloth in
proportion to the price of raw cotton or cotton thread. As a result
a large number of manufacturers have already given up and laid off
their workers.
Yet there is no shortage of materials. On the contrary, the rich mill­
owners have themselves become hoarders, and they have started to
sell their surplus, their speculative cottons, gambling on them, after
having kept back sufficient stocks for their own mills. In short, it is
these shady speculators who own the surplus which the normal con­
sumers are short of, and thus there is no lack of materials in France,
and no threat of a lack: that is the truth of the matter.

The Theory of the Four Movements
In this situation, what has been the benefit of commercial licence
and free competition? They have led to:
1.

2.
3.

Doubling the price of a raw material of which there was no real
shortage, and whose price should have risen very little or not
at all.
Disruption of manufacturing that has been slowly and painfully
established.
The enrichment o f a coalition o f dishonest speculators t o the

detriment of productive industry, and to the disgrace of the
sovereign whom they offend by destroying his work.

These facts are unanswerable. The response to them will be that if
the authorities hindered .free competition, the hoarders ' licence, things
would be even worse. That may be so, but it merely proves that
your economists know of no remedy against hoarding. Is this a
reason not to look for one, and does it therefore follow that hoarding
is beneficial? If you do not know an antidote to a social vice, at
least have the courage to admit that the vice is a disaster, do not
listen to your philosophers when they extol the vice to you in order
to exculpate themselves from being unable to correct it. When they
counsel you to tolerate speculation and hoarding lest some greater
ill befall you, they are no better than an ignoramus who tells you
to encourage fever because he does not know how to cure it.
Just because we do not know what to do to prevent hoarding, is
it sensible to tolerate it endlessly, as we do at present? No. I shall
prove that intervention by the authorities could frequently have
prevented major misfortunes, without committing any violations or
becoming despotic. Let us take an example from the present situ­
ation [ 1 807] .
Suppose that the government, i n order t o save the cotton manu­
facturers who have dealt such an important blow to England, had
wanted to suppress the hoarders, and that the police had called on
a Paris banker who in January had 5 millions' worth of cotton
(purchase price) in store, which he was refusing to sell for 8 million
because he wanted, very moderately, to double his capital in three
months. The authorities could have told him, 'The accumulation
of raw materials amassed by you and your accomplices threatens to
ruin our factories to which you are refusing to sell at a fair profit.
You are hereby ordered to hand over your stocks at a quarter or a

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
fifth profit instead of the twofold profit you intended. Your cottons
will be distributed to small-scale manufacturers (and not to the large
ones, who are themselves hoarders in league with each other to hold
the small factories to ransom).'
What results would such a measure have?
Note first of all that there is nothing oppressive about it, as the
hoarder would get 6 million after three months for stocks which
cost him 5 million, a profit of 20 per cent in three months: this is
four times as much as a landowner would obtain for a year's hard
agricultural work.
And as a result of this demand, all the other hoarders who wanted
to d ouble their capital, and who have been successful in this, would
have decided to sell their cottons at a profit of 20 per cent, and the
factories would have suffered little or no hardship and would not
have been forced, as they have been, to dose workshops and dismiss
workers. This act of authority would have saved the industry and
benefited the government; it would not have delayed the sending
of consignments from our allies, for since the Americans sent us
cotton in 1 807 in the hope of selling it at 1 00 ecus per quintal, they
would certainly have sent it for sale at 1 20 ecus. It is thus dear
that the authorities ought to intervene against hoarding, not in the
way the Jacobins did, who ruined the owners by paying them in
paper money, but by intervening to restrict profits when they
degenerate into extortion.
So whenever there is the prospect of a shortage of any com­
modity, and the threat that this might encourage hoarding by specu­
lators, it will be advisable to declare them not for sale, and to set a
maximum profit by fixing it at a rate high enough to encourage
consignments to be sent, such as a quarter or a fifth above the
normal price. It should be forbidden for anyone except recognised
customers or outlets to buy or trade in them, even indirectly, and
each merchant's supply should be limited in proportion to his usual
markets, which he would have to justify by his average sales over
a number of years.
I shall not indicate the other p �ovisional measures that should be
taken to counter hoarding, as it would be unnecessary to explain
them here, since societary competition or the commercial
procedures of the sixth period prevent hoarding and other disrup­
tions, rather than just suppressing them; but in the absence of these
2 43

The Theory of the Four Movements
preventive measures, it is unpardonable not to have attempted at
least some palliative measures, such as removing goods from sale. That
is what France ought to have done this winter with cotton, because
the prosperity of our factories manufacturing cotton stuffs was
about to deal a serious blow to the British East India Company and
to the factories of England.
Having instead allowed the price of materials to rise to double
the normal rate, have they increased the supply? No. Raw materials
have quadrupled their value without this rise removing the obstacles
standing in the way of consignments from abroad. All that the rise
in price has achieved is the ruin of factories and customers, to the
benefit of the hoarders. Yet in a time of crisis, when normal prac­
tices and regulations can be disregarded, whom is it more important
to protect, the mass of customers and manufacturers, or a few birds
of prey who have come together to disrupt industry by creating
artificial fears and by buying up commodities for which the day
before they had no outlets and no customers, and of which they
have no knowledge?
How easy it would be to confound these speculators by using
their own arguments against them! To believe them, we shall soon
be short of everything: it will soon be impossible to obtain any
commodities, even for their weight in gold. To this the authorities
might reply, 'Either you believe that factories and customers can
be supplied, or you do not. In either case you must be forced to
sell your stocks, for if consignments from abroad are going to cease
from now on, if the scarcity is going to be total, it would be pointless
to protect your machinations, which are accelerating the collapse of
industry by hindering its operation and holding it to ransom at a
time of crisis. If, on the other hand, there are still ways of obtaining
supplies from abroad or elsewhere, you are disruptive alarmists who
are aggravating a temporary difficulty. Thus, whatever your opinion
may be about the cessation or continuation of consignments from
overseas, you deserve to be punished, and you ought to think your­
selves fortunate that we are only banning you from commerce and
putting your stocks up for sale, leaving you the enormous profit of
a quarter more than the normal price.'
Taking this argument further, it would be easy for me to prove
that it would be possible to restrict the hoarders' licence without
interfering with commercial relations [and without leaving the arena
244

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
of civilised politics]: the necessity of this is recognised in relation
to bread and the trade in wheat, which is an area in which all
governments intervene. Everybody knows that if wheat speculators
had complete freedom, and were able to form companies to put a
down-payment on every harvest and put the grain in store, allowing
none to circulate, there would be regular, progressive famines even
in the years of greatest abundance. Even so, speculators have fre­
quently succeeded in reducing a region to starvation, despite the
dangers of the people's anger and of action on the part of the
government, which at times of distress will open the grain stores
and sell the wheat rather than allow the people to be driven to
desperation. If speculators are already bold enough to risk these
dangers, imagine what they would do if they had complete freedom
and were assured of protection for their . hoarding of grain.
You political writers, who compose theories about the duties of
man, will you not admit that the social body also has duties, the
first of which is to suppress the parasites who lay waste to industry
and found their fortunes on the wounds that affiict their country?
If you had had the courage to denounce this sort of corruption you
would not still be trying to find the remedy for it (which is societary
competition) . Even antiquity, with all its absurdities, was wiser than
us in the matter of commercial policy, because it openly condemned
mercantile vices. In those days everybody execrated these industrial
vultures, the hoarders and speculators whom modern philosophy
deems worthy of praise, being the shameless apologist of every sort
of corruption that leads to the accumulation of gold.
Robbery of the social body by speculation
Speculation is next-of-kin to hoarding. Both have won respectability

to the extent that even sovereigns give way to them. They can
directly attack all the operations of princes, who are so taken in by
a few sophisms that they dare not even imagine resisting, or propos­
ing a search for some other system of commerce.
Here is an example of the tyranny that speculation can exercise
over sovereigns. I have chosen a contemporary one, the most recent
escapade of the French speculators.
During the last war against Austria, an obscure mercantile con­
spiracy almost negated the victories at Ulm and Austerlitz. At the
24 5

The Theory of the Four Movements
moment when France was demonstrating the most complete confi­
dence in the operations of the leader of its empire, the speculators
were able to create the symptoms of universal distrust. It was as if
Varro was in command of our armies. In the space of two months
the schemers of Paris wrought unprecedented devastation on
French industry. It took a torrent of miraculous and unexpected
victories finally to muzzle the speculation that threatened to destroy
all public credit, and one shudders to think what financial distress
France would have suffered if it had only had a neutral campaign,
with no successes or defeats.
The arguments of these alarmists were based on an advance
which they said had been made by the Bank of France to initiate
the campaign. They estimated the advance at 50 million, which is
only 1 per cent of France's total territorial revenue; and although
it may not have been guaranteed by the bank's capital or allotment
from taxation, it was surely fully guaranteed in French eyes by
confidence in the sovereign. How could men who feared neither
heaven nor hell when they saw Napoleon at the head of his armies
be afraid for an advance which amounted to a hundredth of the
territorial revenue? Far from being afraid at the start of the cam­
paign, the French willingly committed a portion of their capital,
secure in the knowledge that their Emperor would be victorious,
and without ever having the slightest doubt that this small loan
would be repaid. Nonetheless, speculators were able to create the
signs of general distrust and discredit the bank for fulfilling the
wishes of all Frenchmen by supporting the efforts of their leader.
There is thus a power which takes as little notice of the influence
of heroes as it does of the people's opinion: it is speculation, and it
can control the whole industrial mechanism at will. It leaves empires
at the mercy of a class of parasites who are neither owners nor
manufacturers. They are only concerned for their wallets and, as
they can change their country from one day to the next, their only
interest is in disrupting every region and overturning each branch
of industry in turn. And despite the fact that everybody knows that
our economic theories sustain the scourges of speculation, hoarding,
bankruptcy, etc., in their ceaseless laceration of industry and their
contempt for sovereigns and the trust they inspire in their people despite these outrages and all the others spawned by the system of
commercial licence, no writer has had the courage to denounce this

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
absurd science of economics, to condemn the commercial mechan­
ism as a whole and propose that we should seek a new procedure
based on industrial, rather than commercial, relations. Everybody
genuflects before the commercial vices they rail against in private,
and everybody sings the praises of commerce instead of thinking
of ways to shake off its yoke, because civilised man is too frightened
to contemplate reforms which require a political inventiveness he
thinks is beyond his powers.
The modern philosophers are, no doubt, secretly ashamed of the
results of their mercantile system, but they allow matters to go from
bad to worse out of pride, and continue to encourage the political
pygmies, the speculators and hoarders, because they do not have
the skill to control them. The public becomes used to trembling
and bowing down at the mere name of commerce: such scandalous
behaviour gives the lie to reason's claims to perfection. Political
economy has dragged the modern empires into the mud. We were
less degraded, and Civilisation was less contemptible, in the days
before mercantile philosophy and economic science came into being.
Do you need more details to be convinced that these schemers,
dignified by the name of speculators, are no more than modified
Jacobins, their clubs now turned against industry? Like the Jacobin
clubs, they tend to affiliate together in complete agreement to
enflame any wound that industry suffers. Just as the Jacobins were
adept at interposing themselves between the government and the
people in order to play one side off against the other and thus
control both, the mercantile swindlers make themselves mediators
between government and industry in order to subordinate both to
their intrigues, misleading everybody and outwitting them by means
of a feigned solicitude for the needs of agriculture. Like the clubs,
they have no l egal authority but nonetheless manage to organise
everything in their own interest. Pronouncements by the authorities
in support of factories or agriculture are usually an expression of
the secret wishes of the speculators. It is they who generally reap
the reward of the support the government believes it is giving to
honest industry. These commercial schemers, like the clubs, are
highly skilled in dividing and defeating their rivals. The plan of
attack is the same in both cases: both have secret commissions of
enquiry to prepare the way for major strokes of political disruption;
both hide their intentions beneath a mask of paternalism; in the
2 47

The Theory of the Four Movements
case of the Jacobins, the pretext was the propagation of knowledge;
with the speculators, it is the more efficient circulation of goods or
capital, but in both instances the true purpose is the opposite of
these. Their methods of attack are also similar: the Jacobin clubs
set up counter-conspiracies to their own, after the success of which
they would arrest a thousand victims and put them to death, a
process which they would repeat after their next conspiracy. The
commercial schemers do likewise: they pretend there is some major
difficulty, such as a scarcity of materials, which they have master­
minded by hoarding the commodity in question, then they suddenly
raise its price by some enormous amount, thus holding a thousand
factories that need it to ransom, after which they go on to hoard
some other commodity and ruin more factories and workshops.
So the Jacobins and the commercial swindlers have a single,
shared tactic, both using simulated disasters for purposes of disrup­
tion and ruin. The clubs, which were leagues of poor speculators
aiming to ruin the rich, and the hoarders, who form leagues of rich
speculators in order to ruin the poor, reveal complete similarity in
their methods. Both are Jacobins, the former rough, the latter bland
and sophisticated. This similarity will seem even more convincing
when I have explained how these disruptive elements will spread
and increase in the fourth phase of Civilisation, into which we are
now moving. There the proprietors will have become completely
subjected to commerce, which it is almost impossible to differentiate
from speculation as all rich merchants are more or less implicated
in the conspiracies of speculation and hoarding, despite their
appearance of grief at these scourges which they secretly support
and participate in.
I have already mentioned that the political vices of a profession
are not individual vices. The lawyer who swindles his clients, the
speculator who robs society, are not personally to blame: the fault
lies solely with Civilisation which spawns so many branches of mal­
eficent industry, and with philosophy which has persuaded us that
this corrupt Civilisation is man's social destiny, and that God has
not invented any better way of organising human relations.
Robbery of the social body by commercial wastage

The vice I am about to speak of is not so scandalous as the preced ­
ing ones, but it is no less harmful.

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
In a century which has taken economy to the furthest extremes,
such as replacing coffee with chicory juice, sugar with beet-juice,
and making other savings which only serve to encourage fraud on
the part of merchants and to annoy travellers who are unable to
obtain good food at any price - in such a parsimonious century as
this, why has nobody realised that the principal economy ought to
be economy of hands, a reduction in the numbers of superfluous
agents who are wasted in unproductive jobs like those of commerce?
I have pointed out that we customarily employ a hundred people
on work that would scarcely need two or three if association existed,
and that in the seventh period only twenty men will be needed to
supply the market of a town where today a thousand peasants come
to sell their goods. As far as the industrial mechanism is concerned
we are as inexperienced as peoples who have not yet discovered the
mill, and employ fifty labourers to pound the grain which we crush
today with a single millstone. There is an alarming superfluity of
agents everywhere, amounting on average to four times what is
necessary in all commercial enterprises.
Since philosophy started preaching a love of trade, merchants
have swanned everywhere, even in the villages. Heads of families
give up working on the land and become itinerant salesmen. Even
if they have nothing to sell but a calf, they will waste whole days
loitering about in markets and taverns. This abuse is particularly
prevalent in wine-growing areas, but free competition has infinitely
increased the number of merchants and commercial agents in all
parts of the country. In big cities such as Paris there are as many
as three thousand grocers, when three hundred would be enough
to provide for normal needs. The same proliferation of agents has
occurred in the market towns; a small town which today receives a
hundred commercial travellers and a hundred pedlars in the course
of the year saw perhaps fewer than ten in 1 788, yet there was no
shortage of food or clothing, at very moderate prices, even though
there were only one-third as many merchants as there are now.
This multiplicity of rivals forces them to attempt to outdo each
other in crazy measures that have disastrous consequences for the
social body; for every superfluous agent robs society by consuming
without producing anything. The monks were a case in point. It is
well known that the monks in Spain, of whom there are reckoned
to be 500,000, would produce enough food for two million people
if they went back to agriculture, and the same is true of the
2 49

The Theory of the Four Movements
incalculable number of superfluous traders. When you understand
the commercial system of the sixth period, societary competition, it
will convince you that commerce can be carried on with a quarter
the number of agents it employs today, and that in France alone
a million inhabitants have been lured away from agriculture and
manufacturing to join the crowds of agents created by free compe­
tition. Thus France alone annually suffers the loss of enough food
for 4 million inhabitants, as a result of the mistaken ideas of the
economists.
As well as the waste of productive labour, the present order
causes further wastage of capital and of commodities. I cite as an
example of this one of the commonest of current abuses, cut-throat
competition.
For the last few years, merchants have talked of little else.
Because there are too many of them, they are locked in a relentless
struggle for sales, which become more difficult every day because
of the huge number of competitors. A town that consumed a thou­
sand barrels of sugar when it had ten merchants will still only con­
sume a thousand barrels if the number of merchants increases to
forty, which is what has happened in all the towns in France. So
now you hear these swarms of merchants complaining that business
is bad, when they should be complaining about the superabundance
of traders. They wear themselves out enticing customers and com­
peting for trade, and risk ridiculous sums of money for the pleasure
of wiping out their rivals. It is a mistake to think that merchants are
motivated solely by self-interest: they are also governed by a power­
ful sense of jealousy and pride. Some ruin themselves in pointless
attempts to build up a vast business, others by their obsession with
wiping out a neighbour whose success drives them to despair. Mer­
cantile ambitions may be humble, but they are nonetheless intense;
and if the trophies of Miltiades disturbed the sleep of Themistocles,
so do the sales of one shopkeeper disturb the sleep of the shop­
keeper next door. This is the source of the frenzied competitiveness
which drives so many merchants to ruin or to ceaseless expenditure,
which ultimately has to be borne by the customer, because all waste
is paid for in the last instance by society as a whole. If a new com­
mercial order (societary competition) can reduce the number of mer­
cantile agents and the amount of commercial expenditure to a quar­
ter of its present rate, you will find that the price of goods
2 50

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
diminishes proportionately. Production will then increase to cope
with the increased demand stimulated by the lower prices, and as
a result of the mass of labour and capital returned to agriculture
because of the reduction in the number of commercial agents.
One abuse leads to another. This is as true of commerce as it
is of government: for instance, the extravagance of agents causes
speculation and bankruptcy. Striking proof of this was offered by
the war between the stage-coach companies who would willingly
have carried their passengers gratis in order to damage each other's
business. As people watched them lower their rates in the attempt
to wipe each other out, they said, 'Soon they will be paying us a
premium to take us post. ' It is important to emphasise these details
in order to demonstrate that the economists are grossly mistaken
in thinking that self-interest is the only motive of traders. What
sensible man could have conceived the idea, in cold blood, of carry­
ing passengers post from Paris to Rennes for 1 8 livres tournois.
This is the kind of madness produced by the obsession with wiping
out competitors. The result of these onslaughts, which were enter­
taining for the travellers, was the bankruptcy of the various protag­
onists, who wiped each other out in the space of a few months. Their
bankruptcy was borne by the public, who always become involved
in the craziest schemes; but despite their failure it was the bankrupts
who profited in the end, because their fellow-investors never reco­
vered their money. That is why merchants, who can always take
refuge in bankruptcy if things go badly, are ready to risk everything
to get rid of a rival and glory in a neighbour's misfortune. In this
they are like those Japanese who put out one of their own eyes in
front of their enemy's door, so that the law will put out both of
his.
The long-established commercial firms, perturbed by these wars
of extermination, refuse to have anything further to do with a pro­
fession that has been rendered dangerous and debased by the
intrigues of these newcomers, who often sell at a loss' in order to
' I should explain the phrase sell at a loss. A trader often makes a loss when he
sells for a profit of IO or 15 per cent, as his total expenses, set against his total
sales, make it necessary for him to get a profit of 25 per cent in order to to achieve
a net profit of IO per cent on his capital. But if competition restricts his rate to
15 per cent, he will have hardly any profit at the end of the year, and he will have
lost the interest on his capital and the reward for his labours and the risks he has
taken. This is what happens in honest commerce like the trade in consumables,

The Theory of the Four Movements
attract custom. The traders who do not want to make a loss find
themselves abandoned, deprived of customers, and unable to fulfil
their commitments. Soon both of them find their resources at an
end, and they are obliged to go cap in hand to the speculator, whose
usurious aid increases their difficulties and their insolvency, and
precipitates their collapse.
Thus free competition, by provoking bankruptcies, fuels specu­
lation and encourages the vast expansion of it that we have noted.
Speculators become established even in small market towns. You
come across men everywhere who claim to be bankers, but whose
only profession is lending out money at interestf and encouraging
the wars of competition. By their loans they sustain a host of
superfluous traders who embark on the most ridiculous specu­
lations, and then, when they fail, go to the bankers for help and
get held to ransom by them. The bankers, with their position in
the mercantile arena being to stir up conflict, are like the Arab
hordes who hover around armies, gloating at the expectation of the
ruin of defeated friends or foes.
The spectacle of so much brigandage and absurdity spawned by
commerce can leave us in no doubt that the ancients were wiser
than us when they treated it with contempt. As for the moderns

f

where the profits, unlike with hoarding, arc never large. And that is why you so
often sec honest traders getting nowhere, hardly able to keep going, after they
have been in business for some years, as a result of the excessive competition which
does not allow anybody a return proportionate to their outlay.
It is hard to believe the number of usurers there are in France today. They began
to appear along the Rhine, where the Jews took over a large portion of the great
properties through usury. The scandal is less noticeable in the interior of the
country, because there usury is practised by the indigenous inhabitants. The only
lucrative job these days, apart from hoarding and speculation, is pawnbroking,
lending on mortgages and trading in the bills and bonds of borrowers. Cunning
operators leave commerce in order to practise this pleasant profession, which the
Revolution has encouraged by its dissolution of properties.
I am not arguing that the usurers are to blame. All forms of political corruption
are the product of circumstances, not of the citizens who profit from them. But
it is fortunate in this situation that the Jews are not yet widely settled in France,
as this nation is particularly addicted to usury, and would already have taken over
most of the large properties, and the influence which goes with them. France would
be no more than a vacant synagogue, for if the Jews possessed just a quarter of
the great properties their influence would be immense, because of their secret and
indissoluble brotherhood. This danger is one of the thousand symptoms which
bear witness to social degeneration, the defectiveness of the industrial system, and
the need to reconstruct the whole of society on a new model, if Civilisation con­
tinues any longer, which God grant will not happen.

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
who construct theories in its praise, they are nothing but shameless
charlatans. There can be no hope of seeing the triumph of truth or
good order in the industrial mechanism until they condemn the
commercial system and discover a mode of exchange which is less
oppressive and less degrading for the body of society.
Conclusions on commerce

In the preceding four sections I have established that commerce,
although appearing to serve industry, in fact aims to rob it in many
different ways, and I have cited the four instances of bankruptcy,
hoarding, speculation and waste.

Bankruptcy robs the social body and benefits merchants, who
never have to bear the cost. If a trader is prudent he calculates
the risk of bankruptcy and fixes his profit at a rate that will
cover any anticipated losses. If he is not prudent, or if he is
dishonest (the two qualities are quite close in commercial
affairs), he will lose no time in declaring himself bankrupt,
using the indemnity thus provided as protection against the
cost of twenty other failures. Whence it follows that the damage
done by bankruptcy has to be borne by the whole body of
society, and not by the traders themselves.
Hoarding robs the social body because the rise in the price of
hoarded materials is ultimately borne by the consumer. The
costs fall initially on the manufacturers, though, who have a
factory to maintain, and who make financial sacrifices, manu­
facture their output at a reduced profit, keep on the establish­
ment on which their normal existence is based, in the hope of
better days to come, and end up b el a ted l y passing on the price
rise that the hoarder so promptly subjected them to in the first
place.
Speculation robs the social body by diverting capital sums into
warring with each other in a rigged market, and provides the
ablest players with enormous profits. As a result, farms and
factories can only obtain the capital needed for their develop­
ment by paying an exorbitant rate, and constructive enterprises,
which only slowly and painfully yield a profit, are scorned in
favour of speculation, which absorbs the greater part of the
currency.

Waste or superfluity of agents robs the social body in two ways,
either by removing an enormous number of hands and
employing them i� unproductive labour, or by the immorality
and disorder caused by the bitter struggle of these countless
merchants whose dishonesty sometimes creates impediments
equivalent to a prohibition.g

These examples should be adequate, I think, to demonstrate that
free competition has only worsened industrial relations, not only in

commerce but in all the mechanical and liberal professions to which
its influence has spread. For example:
In less than ten years this anarchic competition has almost
annihilated the great theatres of France. The second city of . the
empire can no longer support its theatre, and from next year there
will be nothing but makeshift melodramas and travelling players.
Som� foreigners arriving in our great cities and seeing nothing but
scenes of literary vandalism will wonder what revolution has ban­
ished the French theatre from its own country. They will be told
that it was sacrificed by economists, following the example of
Robespierre, who said, 'Let the colonies perish for the sake of a
principle. ' The economists similarly have said, 'Let lyric and dra­
matic art perish for the sake of the principle of anarchic
competition. '
' There are thousands o f proofs o f this, but I shall cite just one, the situation when
the dishonesty of Russian and Chinese merchants reached such a peak that it
temporarily severed trade between the warehouses of Khyakhta and Starotsuru­
khaytuy. 'The Russians', says Raynal, 'sent the Chinese false furs, the Chinese
gave the Russians counterfeit ingots (prime examples of both merchants and
civilisation). Mistrust increased so far that trade between them dropped off, and
has been reduced to almost nothing for some time now', although there has been
no relaxation of demand, and the respective sovereigns have encouraged rather
than hindered the caravans.
This impediment only came to light because it had repercussions on a broad
range of affairs. In this case a branch of commerce declined without any restrictions
being placed upon it, solely as a result of dishonest trading. How often does this
sort of dishonesty cause similar obstacles to trade? It causes endless expense, work,
worry and wasted time to everybody who buys goods without being aware of their
true worth. And if after costly precautions, journeys, etc., people are still misled
all the time in their purchases, imagine the saving in time and money if exchange
operated honestly throughout the world. This will be the case in the seventh
period, and even in the sixth it will be rare to find cases of deceit in commercial
transactions.

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
They did not set out with this intention in mind, of course, but
they have acted as if they did, and they have taken no preventative
measures to avert the blow that free competition was bound to
deliver to our great theatres. h
A

Despite their current difficulties, the theatres are still one of the more pleasing
aspects of civilisation. All of them are doing everything they can to plan their
resurgence, but these plans evince all the usual small-mindedness of civilised men,
who can only counter their misfortunes with half-measures that are worse than
the original problems.
It is not very important to understand how the theatres might be restored, as
civilisation is drawing to its close, and the combined order will produce actors in
every canton of the globe who will be as fine as the most famous players in our
capital cities.
But, restricting ourselves to civilisation, it would still be very easy for everyone
to procure their favourite entertainment in each city, by which I mean a good
company in each genre; to have Lekains and Moles by the thousand, so as to be
able to put together companies as good as those in Paris in all towns of twelve to
fifteen thousand inhabitants. The method is easy, consisting of training actors in
special schools rather than waiting for them to be produced at random or for
manna to fall from heaven, and adopting the principle that 'God helps those who
help themselves.'
A well-ordered system of public education should be extended to all professions
that are recognised as useful. And in the current state of luxury, drama is the least
dangerous recreation, in fact is a form of protection against the various excesses
into which the wealthy may be tempted: good actors are therefore eminently useful,
and the foundation of lyric and dramatic universities is all the more urgent since
bad actors are one of the seeds of depravity in society. They only attract people
to their shows for reasons foreign to love of art. Their audience is entirely com­
posed of habitues who are only concerned with flirtation, and care nothing about
the spread of bad taste. They debase masterpieces and their authors by caricaturing
and rendering ridiculous every play they put on. In fact they are the scourge of
morals, taste and the literary glories of the nation. It may be concluded from this
that it would either be better not to have any theatres at all, and provide other
forms of entertainment for people, which has become impossible, or else to take
steps to raise theatrical standards by forming schools for actors, as for all other
professionals. Consequently every town ought to establish a conservatory of the
three theatrical faculties: declamation, song and dance. These conservatories would
pull together and develop the scattered talents to be found in any crowd of poor
children or young people. The Paris school will not train the children of Brussels
or Marseilles, so schools must be established wherever appropriate to develop the
seeds of talent that nature has sown in the towns and villages, and educate those
who are obviously destined for the stage in dramatic and lyric art. They will pract­
ise in the principal theatre of their town, which will thereby increase its reputation
at no expense. They should be encouraged by means of monetary prizes, as a result
of which fathers of poor families will make an effort to encourage their children's
artistic leanings, rather than stifling them at an early age.
Our towns are teeming with children who have been prevented from following
their natural bent, and whose parents could then send them to the conservatory

255

The Theory of the Four Movements

in the hope of seeing them appointed to a well-paid job in a theatre. If it was
properly organised, such a conservatory could before long provide a host of dis­
tinguished actors. They would soon be as abundant as today's untrained tumblers
and players who have entered the profession by chance, and who drive enlightened
drama-lovers away from the theatre they debase. The drama will never attain the
excellence of which it is capable until it is played by properly trained actors whose
style is modelled on the principles of the school in which they have been trained.
Art will then cease to be overwhelmed by the tyranny of fashion. Actors, singers
and dancers will no longer abuse their popularity by erecting their whims into
rules. The traditions of rival schools will become a means of using every aspect
of talent and discouraging the uncontrolled innovations that artists mistake for
signs of genius. Performances will then have achieved a degree of perfection that
will enable them to start influencing morals for the better and encouraging a general
tendency towards the arts. The abundance of good actors and the modest cost of
their services will stimulate authors to write good plays which will be as lucrative
for them as they are currently unrewarding.
The position of actors will then acquire the renown that belongs to real talents
and the occasions at which they are displayed. Is it surprising that the profession
today is degraded by catcalls? A stage full of bad actors repels enlightened and
sophisticated people, attracting instead the majority of its audience from the ignor­
ant masses. Such an audience can exercise no critical judgement, only a degrading
despotism, and proclaims its response with a crudeness in keeping with the worth
of the players. What right do most of the present actors have to be received indul­
gently? A few of them may deserve applause, but the majority of them have no
qualification for the profession apart from boldness. They gain their experience at
the expense of some poor town where they go through their first performances,
and all they bring to the next town is the art of surviving the impact of three
debuts and reducing the groundlings to silence at the end of a fortnight out of
sheer boredom. It is not surprising that the profession has become degraded, and
that so many families despise it when they could make it the object of profitable
speculation. There are few jobs more lucrative than a good actor's. Indeed there
are plenty of indifferent actors whose income is twice that of the military and civil
leaders of a province. That is why it is impossible to maintain good theatres in
the provinces, because actors, even quite ordinary ones, are now so rare and so
demanding that a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants can only afford a small
theatre for popular farces and dramatic monstrosities.
This disorganisation affects France more severely than other countries like Italy
or Germany because it does not possess the same variety of courts, all wanting to
embellish their residences by attracting and encouraging artists, to whom they offer
both respect and fortune. Our great cities cannot emulate this; their entirely com­
mercial population, with their bourgeois attitudes, does not provide any support
or offer any attractions to artists. Outside Paris, the whole of France is a place of
exile and obscurity for genius and the arts; our cities of a hundred thousand inhabi­
tants compare very badly with small German towns like Weimar and Gotha. The
arts and sciences flourish in those minor capitals under the auspices of the generous
patrons who govern them. The cities of France, in contrast, are more barbarous
than civilised when you set them alongside those of Germany and Italy. There the
muses dwell in palaces: in France they can hardly afford a thatched cottage. Every­
thing outside Paris is a village as far as the arts and sciences are concerned. Go
into the museum at Lyons and you will find its displays inferior to those of a
travelling salesman. Go into the library at Lyons and you will find hardly any
256

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism

books, and almost no good modern works at all. Look at the botanic garden in
Lyons, bare of any ornamentation and disfigured by three crude huts: you would
think it was the garden of poor Capuchins. Are these appropriate monuments for
the second city of the greatest empire, for the city that furnishes luxuries for the
four corners of the globe? Once again I say all France is concentrated in Paris.
The scholars and thinkers who live there are animated by a spirit of jealousy, and
take a delight in seeing the degradation of our large cities, for which they never
propose a single benevolent measure.
By their desire to denigrate everywhere else in order to make Paris shine more
brightly, by their eagerness for the small streams that should feed the great river
to dry up, they have succeeded in impoverishing the capital. To speak only of the
theatre, this city which is so well provided with everything that talent can create,
which ought to be extending its excellence to the provinces, is itself in dire straits.
The theatre can only sustain itself by undermining the theatres in the provinces,
requisitioning every actor who attracts their attention, and where it has been pru­
dent enough to provide the provinces with establishments that adorn their repu­
tation, its work is negated by the flood of artists into the capital to display their
talents and supply its inhabitants with new pleasures every day. Paris owes its best
actors to distant provinces. Consider how many there would be if new schools
were able to foster the seeds of talent that nature scatters everywhere and which
could be sought out in the smallest villages as well as in the small towns.
In order to maintain its place in the arts and literature, and thus bear comparison
with the towns of Germany and Italy that are lucky enough to have resident sover­
eigns, France must (assuming that civilisation lasts long enough) put its major
cities on the same footing as court towns, and ensure them as far as possible the
advantages of a royal seat, which they are deprived of by the good fortune of having
a united empire.
To achieve this the State will have to expend money on giving these cities a
semblance of grandeur. There should be a museum, with copies of all the best
paintings in the Paris collection, a library furnished with all the good books that
are in the Paris library, reprinted if need be, and they must be generously endowed
with scientific and artistic foundations such as botanic gardens, physical and natural
history laboratories, national theatres and all the other establishments proper to a
town where a royal court sets up its residence.
If France had twenty kings beneath one emperor, they would give their twenty
capitals the kind of lustre that I have depicted; and as the unity of the country
saves us the expenses such a federal organisation would entail, it is not beyond
our means to compensate those towns by ensuring that they at least possess the
useful foundations they would obtain by the presence of a court, and set them on
a level with the regional capitals which are our rivals in the sciences, in art and
in literature.
Justice and national pride counsel these arrangements, but they would not be
welcomed by the scholars and thinkers of France. Their esprit de corps restricts
their enthusiasm to the city where they are all gathered. Paris is the only place
they care about, and it is one of the pleasures of this fine city to laugh at the
provinces it has systematically debased. Paris is like those dreadful flower-growers
who, whenever they see a tulip or a hyacinth equal to one of their own, buy it,
uproot it and destroy it. Paris is to France what the Dutch are to the Moluccas,
where every year they go and cut down and destroy the clove and nutmeg trees
so that there are none left outside Ambon and Banda Besar. It is surprising, in
fact, that Paris has allowed the famous university at Montpellier to continue when
2 57

The Theory of the Four Movements

its European reputation is so high and so far removed from the ridicule that Paris
likes to heap on the French provinces. For an idea of what they would be capable
of if the sciences and arts were encouraged, think what Geneva was like when it
was self-governing: it was second only to Paris as a centre of learning. (I am only
talking about French-speaking cities.) It might have held an equally high place as
a centre for the arts if its sanctimonious morality had permitted them. At that
period our great cities like Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux and Nantes were almost
devoid of artistic and scientific culture, which only flourish under the eye of sover­
eign authority, or in cities which offer them the means to develop.
Yet why pity the French provinces? These have such a servile character that
they feel honoured whenever an artist or a monument is carried off to Paris to
adorn the capital that disparages them. Like the ancient Muslims who were proud
to die at the order of His Highness, the great cities of France chorus to the
Parisians:
'You do us great honour, my lords,
By crushing us.'
Nobody in Lyons, Bordeaux, Marseilles or Nantes has ever expressed any regret
at this poverty and inferiority in the sciences, arts and theatre. Nobody has ever
proposed a plan by which these cities might share in the glory the capital enjoys.
There is some consolation in noting that Paris has inflicted a degree of punish­
ment on itself by the degradation in which it has left the provinces. To speak only
of the lyric and dramatic arts, how many authors suffer from the despotism of that
city? There compositions are submitted to backstage tribunals from whose judge­
ment there is no appeal, or else jeered at from the pit because all the tickets have
been sold to their rivals. They suffer the misfortune of being unable to find a single
city in the vast empire of France where their work can be given a second chance,
a city where the arts are strong and sustained by a good theatre, a city whose
opinion might carry weight against those of Paris and invalidate its decrees, which
are so often entirely unjust.
This is only one of the many difficulties afflicting artists and thinkers as a pun­
ishment for having encouraged the impoverishment of the provinces. But it is right
that they should have to suffer these annoyances for having wanted to inflict them
on others, and for not having applied the principles of competition they make so
much fuss about to Paris.
Huge numbers of nascent talents are stilled by the despotism the capital exercises
over critical opinion, and by the countless humiliations they have to overcome in
that city which is the only arena in which they can develop and and acquire a
reputation. Sacchini is said to have died of shame after his Oedipus, the greatest
French opera, was greeted with catcalls, which provides an indication of the
number of good authors who have been disheartened by the tyrannical backstage
cabals of Paris. There can be no doubt that the capital stifles competition and
deprives France of a host of excellent artists who would achieve eminence if the
competition of other cities sheltered them from the tyranny of Paris, and enabled
their works to have a fair hearing.
Having made the mistake of not establishing universities of lyric and drama,
they turn out endless jeremiads about the decadence of literature and the theatre,
etc., the explanation for which lies entirely in the absence of any establishments
that could enable our great cities to rival the capital by developing the talents which
at the moment it is deprived of If such foundations are opposed out of motives
of jealousy or sordid economy, you should stop complaining about literary and
25 8

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
All the professions have been disrupted to a greater or lesser
extent by the system of licence extended to commerce, as witness
medicine and the bar. In the years since absolute freedom was insti­
tuted, charlatans have roamed the countryside causing the death of
hundreds of gullible villagers protected by the principle of allowing
competition free reign. Lawyers, too, have adopted the noble customs
of commerce and started touting for practice, stopping country folk
in public squares and on the steps of the law-courts and trying to
solicit their custom. This prostitution of a previously honourable
calling aroused public feeling to such an extent that restrictive
measures, like the reform of the legal register, had to be introduced,
in contradiction of the principles of free competition.
This freedom, like political freedom, has been acted on
thoughtlessly, with no understanding of where these fine philo­
sophical theories might lead. Now people are beginning to see
the error of this, but in trying to remedy it they are making
even worse mistakes, such as confusing the interests of commerce
with those of its natural enemy, manufacture. It will be a long
time before the moderns start to be suspicious of their idol and
realise that the whole commercial system, which is a collection
of all the vices, needs to be changed.
Some might retort that I would do better to announce the remedy
for these vices than to hold forth about them, and that I ought to
hurry up and produce the theory of societary competition which can
root out all these mercantile disorders.
My reply to that is that my intention is not to ameliorate Civilis­
ation but to confound it and to make people want to discover a
better social mechanism, by demonstrating that Civilisation is
absurd in all i ts elements and as a whole and th a t far from per­
fecting reason, the moderns are plunging deeper and deeper into
political insanity, as witness their most recent fantasies such as fra,

theatrical decadence. The only response to your complaints will be that it is quite
right that an empire be lacking in talent if it refuses to cultivate it, in the same
way that it is right for a miser who refuses to contribute towards the cost of the
sowing to receive none of the harvest, not a single seed of which was his. By
neglecting to found conservatories to undertake the general exploitation of chil­
dren's many talents, you are acting like that miser; this failure has left you poor,
despite being surrounded by the . riches nature has sown wherever you look. Like
savages who possess a gold mine, you have to make do with the grains of gold dust
washed down by the stream.
2 59

The Theory of the Four Movements
ternity and the commercial spirit, against which reason and nature
both rebel.
Nature is never wrong in the general impulses it gives to the
human race. When the great majority of people despise a profession
like commerce, and when this feeling is dictated by natural instinct,
you may be sure that the object of their contempt has some odious
hidden quality.
Who is more sensible, for heaven's sake, the moderns who respect
commerce or the ancients who condemned merchants to general
contempt? Vendentes et latrones says the Gospel, drawing no distinc­
tion between the two. This was Jesus Christ's thinking, when he
armed himself with a scourge and drove out the merchants, and
told them with all the candour of the Gospel, ' You have made my
house into a house of thieves. '
Fecistis earn speluncam latronum.

Like Christ, antiquity treated merchants and thieves as the same,
placing them both under the protection of the god Mercury. In that
period it seems that being a merchant was close to disgrace, for St
Chrysostom assures us that no merchant can be pleasing to God.
In consequence, merchants have been excluded from the kingdom
of heaven, although the elect of all professions have been admitted,
even, in the person of St Yves, a lawyer.
I cite these details to establish the opinion of the ancients, which
I want to set beside that of the moderns. I do not by any means
approve the extremism of the ancients: it is as absurd to proscribe
and ridicule merchants as it is to praise them to the skies. But which
extreme is the less absurd? In my view, it is that of the ancients.
If it is true that modern philosophy is a friend of truth, how has
it managed to lend its support to merchants, when they are the
most deceitful element in the whole of society? Judge this for your­
selves from the way they are described today, when they are so
much in favour.
'The Armenians' (says Monsieur Peuchet in his dictionary of
commercial geography)6 'are active and profound dissemblers; they
will stoop to anything, their manner is as false as it is persuasive,

and they will use every means that fraud and artifice can suggest
in a despotic society; they will stop at nothing to get what they
want, including humiliation and perjury; even religion becomes one
more tool in their hands with which to cement their fraudulent
interests. In Russia they adopt the Orthodox rite, in Persia they
follow Islam, etc., etc.'
These few lines are enough to give us an idea of commercial
ethics and the healthy influence they can have over the social order
when they have sufficient power. Our merchants today can lay claim
to the finest traits of the Armenian character. The rich traders,
admittedly, do not share these unpleasant characteristics, because
it is easy to be honourable on 1 00 thousand ecus. But it is no less
true that the commercial spirit corrupts people's politics and
morals. Carthage and England are sufficient proof of that: the
treachery of the politics of Punica fides has become proverbial; as
for the mercantile character, only to be seen in its natural state
among the lower classes, I shall take the example of the Jews,
described in the London Bulletin as follows. 'Two thousand five
hundred Jews who roam the streets and public places, inciting sons
to rob their fathers and servants to rob their masters, and who pay
for the stolen goods in base coin. '
Yet despite so much commercial depravity, which must outrage
any honest soul, and despite the evidence of reasoned analysis of
commercial activities, which reveals their parasitic, subordinate and
disruptive interventions,' commerce has risen to a position of the
' Let us take a closer look at the worthlessness of merchants and the importance of the
manufacturers whose interests the philosophers want to treat as one. The managers
of factories could easily take over the merchants' activities; they could buy their raw
materials direct, deliver the finished products straight to their customers, or send out
their clerks to deal with sales and distribution. The merchants, on the other hand,
cannot replace the manufacturers, nor manufacture goods in their absence.
If a city loses its merchants, as happened in Marseilles during the plague, new
merchants soon appear, however unconducive the situation may be to commerce.
But if a city loses its manufacturers, as has happened at Louvain, you do not find
new manufacturers moving their workshops there. There will always be plenty of
merchants wherever there is the opportunity to trade freely and profitably. Factor­
ies arc only set up in places where the whole situation favours them and where
they are certain to be successful. The departure of manufacturers from a region
would put all the suppliers of materials and commission agents, who depend on
the factories, out of work, whereas the departure of all the merchants would not
bring the factories to a standstill, because the managers and clerks could take the
merchants' place.

highest authority in the opinions of the moderns. This was bound
to be the case, as Civilisation is essentially favourable to treachery.
The influence of commerce is leading it towards an even more
unpleasant and treacherous industrial system, the seeds of which I
shall indicate.
I realise my criticisms may seem misplaced, even outrageous,
until such time as I have explained the mechanism that can replace
commerce, and institute the reign of truth and order in the place
of commerce's treachery and absurdity. In the mean time I
denounce the cowardice of the writers and thinkers who have not
dared to devote themselves to the search for it, and who dare to call
themselves friends of truth while acting as apologists for commerce.
In the absence of any such initiative on the part of the writers,
some administrators have tried to introduce remedies for commer­
cial anarchy, but they have merely gone from Charybdis to Scylla:
the fixed number of masters by which anarchy is to be replaced is
worse than no remedy at all. After the Jacobin clubs, this is the

Thus when the French Protestants emigrated to Germany, their place was not
taken by catholic manufacturers, and industry went abroad with them. But if Louis
XIV had only proscribed merchants and bankers, and allowed manufacturers to
stay, within a year there would have been enough new catholic merchants to take
the place of all the protestant ones, France would only have sustained a loss of
manpower and money, which can be replaced, instead of the loss of industry, which
is irreparable. All the powers today are eager to establish mercantile bases in the
Orient, whereas none of them is trying to set up European manufacture there. On
the contrary, they would like to attract Chinese and Indian industry to Europe
without being in the least worried about attracting merchants and seafarers from
those countries. The further we take this parallel, the more convincing the argu­
ment becomes that merchants and bankers need to be closely watched, and restric­
ted to the useful functions I described above. If they are given complete licence
as the economists recommend, they use their capital to attack industry, in imitatio�
of undisciplined soldiers who, released from the fear of punishment, immediately
start pillaging their own country instead of keeping order there.
262

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
Greek day-dreams about the rights of man, which have become so
ridiculous. After the revolutions that they caused, we are now head­
ing for more troubles because we have forgotten the chief and only
useful right among them, the right to work. Our politicians have
never even mentioned it, which is entirely in keeping with their
habit of omitting all the most important questions in every branch
of knowledge.
There are numerous infractions of this right: I shall cite one, the
case of the chartered companies who control an area of work and
block the path of new applicants and deny them conditional entry.
The influence of these companies does not become a danger or
bring about revolution except insofar as their rules extend to the
whole commercial body. This new development requires some
investigation, as it will become established more easily if we are not
forewarned about its consequences.
The greatest evils often spring from imperceptible origins, as wit­
ness Jacobinism. Clubs did exist before the French Revolution:
many of their members were men of great integrity, and nobody
could have suspected that such groupings harboured the seeds of a
greater tyranny than that of Nero and Tiberius, which only affected
the great and the factious in the capital, whereas the persecution
of the clubs extended right down to the poorest citizens and the
obscurest hamlets.
And if Civilisation took twenty-five centuries to engender that
calamity, might it not produce others which cannot be foreseen?
The most imminent of these would be commercial feudalism, in
which commerce would be the exclusive province of a league of
chartered companies.
Extremes meet, and the more commercial anarchy has grown,
the greater has been the tendency towards universal privilege, which
is the opposite extreme. It is the fate of Civilisation to be constantly
swinging from one extreme to another, unable to settle for the
happy medium.
Several circumstances tend to encourage traders to unite, and
organise themselves into federal companies, into groupings of
monopolists who, with the support of the great landowners, could
reduce all those below them to commercial vassalage, and achieve
control over the whole of production by their combined intrigues.
The small landowner would then be forced indirectly to dispose of

The Theory of the Four Movements
his harvests in a way that met with the monopolists' agreement;
he would in fact have become an agricultural agent of the commer­
cial coalition. The final result of this would be the renaissance of
an inverse feudalism, founded on mercantile leagues rather than
leagues of nobles.
Everything conspires to prepare the way for this outcome: the
spirit of speculation grips the great; the old nobility, ruined and
dispossessed, seeks distraction in the intrigues of trade; the descend­
ants of the old knights have an excellent knowledge of prices and
the frauds of the Stock Exchange, just as their ancestors excelled
in tournaments. Public opinion bows down before the people they
call businessmen, who have as much authority in the capital cities as
ministers, and every day are discovering new means of taking over
some branch of industry or other. Under their influence, govern­
ment - without intending to - begins to take possession of com­
merce as they seize it bit by bit and long to take it over entirely by
a general process of farmage. For all the fine promises to guarantee
the freedom of commerce now begin to look like the vows of our
notorious republicans who, all the time they were swearing mortal
hatred of royalty, really wanted to ascend the throne themselves.
We are therefore moving very rapidly towards commercial feudal­
ism and the 4th phase of Civilisation. Writers and thinkers, used to
revering everything that comes in the name of commerce or for the
good of commerce, will observe the creation of the new order with­
out any qualms and devote their trite pens to apologetics on its
behalf. Its appearance will be welcomed on all sides, as were the
clubs, and it will lead to the industrial inquisition, and the subjection
of all citizens to the intrigues of the united monopoly.
(If you want to know how to escape this scourge, you can consult
the note below, which will be of little interest except to merchants.1

Proportional access to professions or The middle way between free competition and com­
mercial farmage.
This would be a debate of the greatest importance if civilisation were to continue
even for another ten years. But as that misfortune is unlikely to happen, it will be
enough merely to touch on the question, and show that commerce is in danger of
being subjected to farmage because of the need to remedy its increasing anarchy.
Although it is necessary to reduce the numbers of every sort of commercial
agent, it would be equally cruel to exclude them all at a stroke by limiting access
to professional positions. What could be more unjust than to hand over a branch
of industry to a league of hoarders who for a paltry price would obtain the right
to exclude, incarcerate or impoverish their competitors? To allow such a regime

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
would be to reproduce in all its detail the English system of monopoly that has
been so bitterly criticised.
Exclusive leagues of this sort have only taken over relatively unimportant jobs
up to now, existing only among artisans and the subordinate agents of commerce
known as brokers or exchange agents. This is why they have not caught the atten­
tion of observers and why nobody attaches any importance to the equity or iniquity
of their rules.
These leagues have made use of their obscurity to make a rapid assault on char­
tered status, which they have obtained very cheaply, at a third or a quarter of its
value. They also took careful steps to ensure that the price put on the concession
was not so high as to invalidate their derisory offers.
They cloak their encroachment under various plausible motives, talking about
the certain disruption that would follow if unlimited applicants were allowed to
enter their trade. These disruptions, which I have described under the heading of
anarchic competition, are no reason to go from a bad situation to a worse one, from
licence to persecution. The need is to find a middle way between uncontrolled
admission and an exclusive league. This I shall now describe: the calculation
involved is child's play, requiring no special understanding, only the kind of fair­
minded outlook which economists almost never have.
The procedure I call progressive finance has to proceed by taking regular
soundings. It consists in demanding an interest-free surety and a licence from
everybody engaged in industry, particularly unproductive workers such as mer­
chants. Both the surety and the licence will increase from year to year, as in the
table below.

500 livres

i.e . a payment each year of I ,ooo livres more than the original payment, indepen­
dent of the increasing licence cost.
Payment continues at this rate until there is a fall in the number of agents and
the number entering the job is equal to the number leaving through death or
retirement. At this point the surety and the licence will have reached equilibrium,
where they remain fixed until new circumstances, such as peace or war, diminish
or augment the industry's field of operation, when progressive finance follows the
new impetus by rising or falling in relation to the rapid increase or decrease in
the number of applicants, who must never be excluded as long as they meet the
required conditions of entry.
Applied to commerce, this measure will rapidly raise association to the highest
level, because the annual rise in surety and licence payments, and that alone, will
lead merchants to forget their jealousies and form associations of ten, twelve or
fifteen companies so that they only need to make a single payment.
As soon as one of these large associations is formed the scale of its savings and
the size of its resources will force all the isolated companies to come together in
similar associations, to alleviate the burden of surety payments and the struggle of
26 5

The Theory of the Four Movements
keeping up with them as individuals, which would obviously lead to ruin in
the Jong run, as anybody who tried to carry on in isolation would be refused
credit.
Once these large groupings have been established, the government can begin
the operations (joint liability, supplementary payments, etc.) which will result in
societary competition, and put an end to bankruptcy, speculation, hoarding, waste,
etc. I shall not go into these measures now, merely observing that progressive
finance, which is only the prelude to the establishment of good commercial order,
attains three important ends:
I.

It reduces the number of agents, without violent measures, without personal
exclusion and without oppressive privilege.
It creates association, which is the basis of all economics and of everything
desirable in a commercial system.
It assures the revenue of the proportional taxation of those professions which
it cannot easily reach, such as commerce, the bar and medicine, which in the
present order have ways of evading public charges and defaulting on their
financial obligations.

All other measures apart from progressive fi nance lead to arbitrary action or con­
fusion, which damages government and industry alike and sanctions conflict
between the privileged and the persecuted. The latter, driven to despair by the
exclusion that condemns them to poverty, wear themselves out in ruses to avoid
the ban on working and in resisting the oppression of companies that want to crush
them, without allowing them any hope of being admitted into a job.
All limited-entry leagues do away with wage competition and emulation. This
can be seen in the recent example of the lawyers who were sufficiently numerous
for emulation to bring the price of their services down to a moderate level. In fact
the opposite happened. They formed an agreement among themselves to raise their
charges to such an oppressive rate that the government had to suppress them by
means of a tariff. But even if the tariff had been successful, which it was not, fixing
salaries in that way would not have encouraged competitive emulation, because any
league of limited numbers, recognising that the public needs to use their services,
obtains its profit by annoying them and only exercising its profession in comfort,
with no rivals to contend with. Try to establish a fixed number of stevedores in
the docks and you will soon see them forming coalitions to control commerce and
hold the merchants to ransom. That is why merchants fear nothing so much as
exclusive leagues among their servants, and why all traders employ non-titulary
members of the profession as brokers and exchange agents. They know that without
their competition the possessors of exclusive charters would soon become indolent
and fussy to the point where they neglected the unrewarding side of their work
and only took on simple and lucrative dealings, so that in the end the merchants
themselves would have to do all the things they did not like doing. Besides it is
very maladroit of the merchants, the freest group in society, to have voluntarily
placed themselves under the control of their brokers, who can denounce a merchant
and have him punished if he makes use of someone else's services. It is a comical
arrangement that sets the servant above the master. If the merchants had a modi­
cum of self-respect, they would band together to exclude this oppressive agency
until it undertook to moderate its privileges, which are utterly contrary to good
sense and fairness.
Out of the many abuses spawned by exclusive leagues, I want to cite just one,
which is the way exclusion in the long run hits all the candidates most worthy of
admission.
266

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
Suppose that a charter limits the number of doctors in a town to thirty, and
that Boerhaave, who is still young, presents himself when the corporate league is
already complete. Boerhaave will be permanently excluded from practising medi­
cine, for the following reasons:
First of all, he will wait patiently until one of the places falls vacant. The moment
arrives, but do not think his talent will be enough to ensure his admission. The
vacant place will be given to some relative or associate of the group, or to some
cunning adventurer who gets to the minister's office a day before Boerhaave - we
all know that honourable, studious men are terribly bad at intrigue. In addition,
fixed-number corporations like to enjoy their privileges in comfort and would be
afraid of admitting a colleague who was too intelligent or too active, as he would
create embarrassing and detrimental competition. These considerations will be suf­
ficient reason for him to be eliminated; he will be rash enough to complain, for
talented men seldom display the pliancy needed in civilised intrigues. His com­
plaints will alienate the corporation even more and they will end up by rejecting
him altogether.
In this way, the system of a fixed number of professionals tends in the long run
to exclude those with the greatest aptitude. After less able people have been chosen
over their heads a few times, they will be afraid to wait for the next death and
risk being turned down again as a result of new intrigues. They will take some
other job and live out their days in pointless tedium, lost to society, for man
becomes nothing if he cannot occupy the position that nature intended for him.
All these drawbacks are prevented by progressive finance, which also has two
advantages which are most unusual in civilisation: it rejects mediocrity and protects
the hard-working poor candidate by means of the surety which at first sight might
appear to have the opposite effect.
The higher the surety is raised, the more it will cut out all those parasitic individ­
uals whose fathers push them into a profession without considering their aptitude
for it, and who clutter up the bar, medicine and commerce because it costs them
hardly anything to carry on their business.
But the surety will not exclude someone who is poor and clever; indeed if Boer­
haave comes from a poor family and develops an outstanding talent in school he
will be assured of the support of capitalists looking for talents to invest in as sleep­
ing partners, entrusting speculative funds to someone whose abilities promise a
good return, preferably a young man not brought up in comfort but spurred on
by need. Thus Boerhaave, linking his talents with the need to make money from
them, will have no difficulty finding his surety payment, while the lenders consider
that they have made a good bargain by enabling him to practise a profession whose
profits they will share.
I have given you an idea of how progressive finance and the proportional control
that stems from it can reconcile the interests of a prince and his subjects, and
how the opposite result is achieved if control is established in a fixed number of
charter-holders, as we are seeing today.
Let me conclude by saying that in the absence of this measure the whole of
commerce is on the point of falling into chartered control, because the operation
has already been put into practice in two extreme cases, the colonial East India
companies and the like, and brokerage companies, which by exclusive charter exer­
cise the most important and least important functions of commerce respectively.
Commerce is thus under attack at both extremes by the chartered companies. It
is, as it were, surrounded and under siege. In this situation, what prevents them
from taking over everything? Only each prince's shortage of money. Some innov­
ative thinkers will propose the farmage of commerce, and coming at a time of
penury this plan will be welcomed all the more because it offers not only the

The Theory of the Four Movements
prospect of improvement but also the benefit of enabling large and immediate
payments to be made to public institutions. Once commercial charters have been
admitted into one kingdom, they will necessarily spread to other states too because
their isolated merchants would be made fools of by the companies of the neighbour­
ing empire, who would have the same advantage in that conflict as a regular army
has against undisciplined bands.
There is no need to concern ourselves with the results of this new industrial
order, which constitutes the fourth phase of civilisation, or commercial feudalism,
with the sovereign as leader. Let us merely note that civilisation is rapidly heading
towards this political and economic revolution as a result of two successive blunders
on the part of the economists.
The first was to have adopted anarchic competition, the principle of complete
laissez-faire for merchants which has had such unfortunate results that they have
had to look for ways of restricting it. The second was to have adopted or tolerated,
as a means of such restriction, chartered control by a fixed number of practitioners,
instead of free control by an undetermined number which fluctuates in relation to
circumstances. There is no need to add that this second kind of control is a sixth­
period measure: the fact that it encourages equity and freedom is enough to mark
it off from the characters of civilisation, and for it to have escaped the notice of
the philosophers, who are always at odds with justice, liberty and truth.
As the scholars only have a theory of commerce and no practical experience of
it, and the traders have only practical experience without a theory, the opinions
of both are equally dangerous; and the administration has good reason to complain
that nobody understands anything about commercial politics, in which everybody
competes in incompetence. To prove this I shall list the faults of the three respect­
ive parties.
I have already explained those of the economists.
The faults of the administration, as far as commerce is concerned, are the
responsibility of the Constituent Assembly, which is as adept at destroying as it
is incapable of constructive measures, and thus has increased anarchy in commerce
as everywhere else.
They ought to have foreseen that, having suppressed the nobility to make way
for the rich, the influence of these obscure beings would in the end force the
government into retrograde actions, like re-establishing a nobility to act as a coun­
ter-weight (in the commercial sense) that would keep the traders' activities within
the limits appropriate to their profession. Whereas at present, glorying in the
absence of distinctions and the flattery of the economists, they have abandoned
themselves to unrestrained luxury, which fuels their immorality, their dangerous
speculations, their bankruptcies and all the other unregulated behaviour whose
rapid growth forced the return to a harmful system of limited access to professional
positions, in the absence of an understanding of the system of proportional access.
The faults of the traders are:
That they allowed themselves to be taken in by the theories of the philosophers,
although they were aware of their maleficence: for there is not one of them who
does not complain daily about the chaos attendant upon the endless multiplication
of merchants.
That they heedlessly allowed their freedom and their privileges to be under­
mined by limited access to the professions, which leads to commercial preference:
from then on, the administration could use their own arguments against them, and
say: ' Your chambers of commerce have pronounced in favour of corporations with
limited access, and said that representatives and control agents should put up
268

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
It indicates the only way they can retain their liberty, which they
are a hair's breadth away from losing. The administration is secretly
outraged at the way they avoid all taxes, their quota of which they
would contribute under the system of proportional control, which
would save them from farmage. See below. )
Thus in a single generation the philosophers have twice commit­
ted the absurdity of driving social movement into regression. The
first time was by an excess of political freedom which, in 1 793, led
Europe rapidly towards barbarism. The second was by an excess of
commercial freedom which is today making us sink rapidly towards
a feudal order. These are the sad consequences of our trust in these
scientific charlatans whose only purpose in life is to provoke contro­
versy in order to sell enough books to live. Philosophy needed to
have some illusory object of belief to take the place of the theological
discussions they put an end to, and the object they chose was the
golden calf of commerce, which they have turned into a social
religion and a subject of academic debate. The hundred-tongued
voice of fame no longer looks to the muses or their nurslings, but
to commerce and its heroes. Wisdom, virtue, morality, all these
have fallen out of fashion: everybody worships at the shrine of com­
merce. A nation's true greatness, what the economists regard as its
true glory, is to see more pairs of trousers to the neighbouring
empire than it buys from them.
guarantees or sureties, as they are only your commission agents (representatives
being no more than travellers in other people's lies, to which they add their own);
but in fact it is far more urgent to demand a guarantee from the traders, who arc
trustees of the public wealth, whereas their representatives are trustees of nothing
but words: consequently, you traders may be certain that you will be forced to
provide sureties yourselves . ' To which the chambers of commerce will only be able

to reply AMEN, and tell themselves, You asked fo r it, Georges Dandin.
The faults of the three parties I have just described, and the consequent move­
ment towards the fourth phase, create a complex of ineptitude typical of our econ­
omic perfection. And the things I could say if I went on to look at other areas of
commerce! This is the sum of enlightenment of a century that heaps up volume
after volume on social policy! Poor scholars and wretched people, what chaos your
civilisation is in! How astounded you will be when the theory of passionate counter­
march allows you to see clearly through the vast maze of civilisation, in which
philosophers, kings and peoples are nothing but groups of blind men, bumping
into each other in the dark, losing each other in the belief that they are serving
each other, and demonstrating by their errors the supremacy of the passions whose
playthings they all arc, and the necessity of studying the laws of these controllers
of the world, instead of trying to dictate our laws to the passions.

The Theory of the Pour Movements
Always eager for some new infatuation, France had blindly to
commit itself to the latest stupidity. The consequence is that
nobody can think or write or speak except in support of commerce.
Even the greatest are slaves to this obsession: any minister who
wants to be popular has to promise vast and thriving quantities of
commerce to each market town; a great nobleman travelling through
the provinces has to declare in every town he stops at that he is a
friend of commerce, travelling for the good of commerce. The finest
minds of the nineteenth century are those who can explain the mys­
teries of the Stock Exchange in pounds, shillings and pence. [Poetry
and the fine arts are despised and] the temple of memory is only
open to those who understand why sugar has weakened or why soap
has eased. Since philosophy contracted this passion for commerce,
Polyhymnia has sown the new science with flowers. The old lang­
uage of merchants has been replaced with the suavest expressions,
so that people talk elegantly about sugar easing or weakening, which
means it has gone down in price, and soap doing very well, which
means going up. There was a time when corrupt conspiracies like
hoarding aroused writers' indignation: now underhand activities of
that sort bring glory to their instigators, whose fame is announced
in glowing Pindaric terms that proclaim, 'Soaps have experienced
rapid and unexpected movement.' We seem to see the boxes of soap
leap up towards the clouds, while the universe echoes with the
sound of the soap hoarders' names. Any object connected with com­
merce, from a promissory note to a piece of cheese, inspires the
philosophers' prose to the sublimest heights of rapture. A touch of
their pen transforms a barrel of liquor into a bottle of attar; cheeses
exude the scent of roses, and soaps outdo lilies in whiteness. All
these flowers of rhetoric make a potent contribution to the success
of industry, which has found the philosophers' support as much
help as the people have: lots of talk and no action.
Rousseau might well say of the present that absurdity has
changed since Moliere, but we do not have a Moliere to portray
the new absurdities. Is there anything in all the noise of mercantile
theories, apart from a verbosity designed to make the presses groan
and stimulate argument among people with nothing better to do,
that can explain the magnetic power and the freedom that Trado­
mania enjoys?

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
Has there ever been so much disorder in industry as since the
mercantile spirit took over? Just because one island nation took
advantage of the inactivity of the French ancien regime to grow rich
on monopoly and piracy, the whole of classical philosophy must be
wrong! Trade is the only path to truth, wisdom and happiness!
Merchants have become pillars of the establishment while govern­
ments try to outdo each other in debasement before a nation that
buys them for a tenth the amount of the industrial tax it anticipates
from them!
Looking at the way that kings and peoples have been outwitted
by a few commercial sophisms, it is tempting to believe in magic,
especially as they praise the maleficent class of speculators, hoarders
and other industrial pirates who only use their influence in order
to accumulate large sums of capital so that they can create fluctu­
ations in the price of every commodity, upset every branch of indus­
try in turn, and impoverish the labouring classes [agricultural work­
ers, factory workers . . . ] who are robbed en masse by speculative
hoarding, like thousands of herrings being swallowed up by the
mouth of a whale as it breathes in.
Let us leave the subject of commerce now. In the course of the
preceding discussion, I have already announced what effects societ­
ary competition, the antidote to the present order, will have.

It will allow the great associations, which are the basis of any
economy, to operate without restraints and without exclusive
charters.
It will make the commercial body its own insurer, and all com­
modities being traded will be held in trust rather than owned
outright.
I t will transfer all the capital o f commerce t o agriculture and
manufacturing. Because once society as a whole is insured
against any malpractice on the part of merchants, everybody
will trust them completely, as a result of which they will not
need to charge more than a nominal sum, and all the currency
can be returned to productive work.
It will return three-quarters of those currently employed
unproductively in commerce to productive labour.
By means of progressive finance, it will make the commercial

body subject to the public taxes which they are presently able
to evade.
And last, it will establish good faith in trading relations. Not
to the extent that will be apparent in the combined order, it is
true, but to a vast extent in comparison with the dishonesty
that prevails at the moment.

This glimpse of what is to come may whet your appetite for a
chapter on societary competition, but as I have pointed out, this
prospectus is limited to demonstrating the ignorance of the philos­
ophers and pointing out the aims they ought to have set themselves.
And anyway, why pause on ways of perfecting Civilisation borrowed
from the sixth period, like societary competition? What do the
improvements of the sixth and seventh periods really matter, when
we can j ump right over them and move straight to the eighth, which
thus becomes the only period worth thinking about?
When we have achieved that goal, when we are enjoying to the
full the comfort of the combined order, then we can argue as long
as we like about the vices of Civilisation and their remedies. Like
war, it will look better when it is over. Then we shall be able to
enjoy ourselves by analysing the civilised mechanism, which is the
strangest of them all, as it has the greatest complexity of incentives.
But our task now is to emerge from it, rather than studying it or
improving it. This is why I am always trying to persuade readers
of the necessity of rejecting all half-measures and going straight to
the goal by immediately founding a canton of progressive Series.
By providing a demonstration of passionate harmony, these will
remove the philosophical cataract from the eyes of mankind, and
rapidly raise all civilised, barbarous and savage nations to their social
destiny of universal unity.

272

Epilogue: On the social chaos of the globe
You authors of the inexact sciences claim to be working for the
good of the whole human race. Do you think that the six hundred
million barbarians and savages are not part of it? Yet they suffer.
And what have you done for them? Nothing. Your systems are only
applicable in Civilisation, whose misfortunes are aggravated each
time your policies are put into practice. When you possess the art
of making us happy, perhaps you will think you are fulfilling God's
design by trying to limit happiness to the inhabitants of Civilisation,
who occupy only a tiny part of the globe. But God sees the human
race as a single family, all of whose members have a right to its
blessings. He wants either the whole of mankind to be happy, or
nobody at all.
If you want to promote the wishes of God you must seek for a
social order that is applicable to the whole of the globe, not just to
a few nations. The vastly greater number of savages and barbarians
ought to warn you that they must be governed and controlled by
attraction, not by force. Do you imagine you could win them over
by the prospect of your customs, which can only be maintained by
the use of gallows and bayonets? Customs which even your own
people hate, and which all countries would rise up against if they
were not held back by fear of the whip!
Far from governing the human race and bringing it into unity,
your theories arouse nothing but profound scorn among barbarians,
and your customs provoke the savage's irony, whose most potent
curse on an enemy is to say, 'May you be reduced to ploughing a
field.' These words could be regarded as a curse from nature itself;
2 73

The Theory of the Four Movements
and it is indeed quite right that civilised industry should be rebuked
by nature since it is abhorred by free peoples who would embrace
it at once if it accorded with the natural passions of man.
Which is why God has never permitted this kind of work to
spread, and has not allowed civilised agriculture, which is such
thankless work for those who bear the weight of it, to be extended
to the rest of the globe. He has confined it to a few areas in China,
India and Europe where there are teeming numbers of indigents,
reserve bodies to help organise the combined order and ensure that
from the outset it will be adequately supplied with a mass of agricul­
tural workers. These wretches will then be able to be moved from
the areas where they are an encumbrance, and directed by the
Emperor of Unity to appropriate places in order to begin the pro­
cess towards the full exploitation of the globe.
All your attempts to extend civilised industry and spread incoher­
ent labour across the globe are in vain, though. God (for a variety
of reasons which I cannot go into here) would never allow an order
so contrary to his designs to extend to all cultivable lands and has
taken pn:cautions to confine it either by civil wars or by invasions
of barbarians.
Industry may have made some progress in Europe, but it has lost
vast areas of Asia. Civilisation may have founded a few feeble colon­
ies in America, now threatened with collapse by the revolt of the
negroes, but has it not lost vast empires nearer home, Egypt,
Greece, Asia Minor, Carthage, Chaldea and part of Western Asia?
Industry has been stifled in large and beautiful regions such as Bac­
tria, where it had begun to become established, and the empire of
Samarkand, once famous in the Orient, and all the regions between
the Oxus and the mouth of the Indus, have regressed politically
and formed hordes once again. The vast empire of Hindustan is
rapidly approaching ruin under English tyranny, provoking a dis­
taste for agriculture, and assimilation into the Marattas whose
hordes already form a powerful nucleus of Tartars in the centre of
the Moghul. In time they will be able to take up a position in the
Western and Eastern Ghats, and bring together the peoples of the
Malabar and Coromandel Coasts, turning them against industry by
their incursions.
The hordes are making daily inroads into the cultivated areas of
Asia, spilling further and further beyond their natural boundary,
274

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
the Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Bokhara to
China. At our very gates, the hordes are surging all over Turkey.
Fifty more years of persecution from the Ottoman Empire and we
shall see the whole of that fine empire returned to the life of nomads
or Tartars, who are making terrifying progress against Turkish
domination. Other formerly flourishing Empires, such as Pegu and
Siam, have relapsed into total weakness and degradation, and their
culture, like that of Turkey, seems to have hardly more than a
century of life left. If the current disorder of the globe is prolonged,
the vast expanse that is Asia will start abandoning industry every­
where. Even China itself, that colossus of tight-fistedness and
absurdity, is visibly declining. The most recent reports of Van­
Braam have certainly disabused us about its pretended splendour. 7
The social spirit has been debased since the influx of Tartars; the
hordes occupy huge areas of territory, and for all this great empire's
much-vaunted industry, only four leagues from Peking you come
across fine land almost unknown and untouched. In the southern
provinces, meanwhile, the priests appeal in vain to the people to
work the fields: whole regions are left fallow as more and more
people join the hordes. The horde is a volcano, always ready to
engulf Civilisation. It is inveterate, no sooner stifled than ready to
erupt again, reappearing as soon as no steps are taken to hold it in
check. In the end, this universal tendency of wage-earners to go
back to living in hordes brings all political questions back to one
single problem: Finding a new social order that ensures the least
important workers enough comfort for them constantly and passionately
to prefer work to the state of inertia and brigandage they aspire to today.
As long as you continue to leave this problem unresolved, nature
will subject you to perpetual attack. You will raise up empires only
to see them become playthings of nature, which loves to plunge
them into revolutions. You are a burden to nature, a prey nature
uses for her own vengeance. Your scientific miracles always lead to
indigence and reversals; your heroes and legislators are building on
sand, and all the foresight of a Frederick cannot prevent weak suc­
cessors seizing the throne the moment he is dead. Civilisation cre­
ates new heroes for the sole purpose of humiliating the heroes of

the past, using the former to belittle the figures who were respon­
sible for all the lustre Civilisation possesses. Surely this prospect of
being followed by weak successors must make great men worry, and
prevent them from enjoying their present triumphs because of the
painful thought of the changes to come? Surely they must hate the
treachery of Civilisation which uproots and overturns their work
the moment they are dead? The civilised order is indeed increas­
ingly insecure. The first eruption of the volcano created by the
philosophers, in 1 7 89, will be followed by others as soon as a weak
ruler makes the conditions right for agitation. The war of the poor
against the rich has been such a success that schemers in every
country want to start it again. There is no point in trying to stop
them: nature makes fun of our understanding and foresight and can
start revolutions with the measures we think we are taking to ensure
calm. If Civilisation continues for another fifty years, how many
children will be begging at the door of their fathers' house? I do
not dare say any more without including the calculus that will guide
politics through the maze of the passions and free the world from
Civilisation as it becomes more revolutionary and hateful than ever.
Civilised nations! Barbarians do not have your understanding,
but they can sustain their societies and institutions over thousands
of years; why then are yours eclipsed so quickly, often in the same
century that they were created? You are always lamenting the
fragility of our works and the cruelty of nature for causing the
wonders of man to crumble into dust. You must stop attributing
these reversals to time and chance: they are the effect of divine
vengeance on your criminal societies and their utter failure to pro­
vide work and subsistence for the poor. It is in order to get you to
admit your ignorance that nature puts your empires to the sword
and thrives on their rubble.
Let me echo your political elegies for a moment: What has
become of the monuments of civilised vanity? Thebes and Babylon,
Athens and Carthage, are turned to piles of ashes! Not a good prog­
nostication for Paris and London and these modern empires where
the craze for mercantilism is a burden on reason and nature alike.
So, tired of our societies, nature overturns them, one by one, ridicu­
ling our virtues and our crimes without distinction. Laws regarded
as oracles of wisdom or ephemeral codes cobbled together by agi­
tators - both lead equally to political shipwreck.

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
To add insult to injury, the crude laws of China and India have
withstood the hands of time for 4,000 years, while miracles of civil­
ised philosophy disappear like shadows. Despite all our efforts to
consolidate empires, the sum total of our knowledge seems to have
provided nothing but toys for vandalism, which re-emerges period­
ically and in a short time destroys the work of several centuries.
A few monuments have survived, but only to bring shame on
politics. Rome and Byzantium, once capitals of the greatest empire
in the world, have become cities of ridicule. The temples of the
Caesars on the Capitol have been taken over by the gods of obscure
Judaea. The christian basilicas on the Bosphorus have been sullied
by the gods of ignorance. In the one place, Jesus stands on the
pedestal of Jupiter, in the other Mahomet is placed at the altar of
Jesus. Nature preserved you, Rome and Byzantium, to be objects
of scorn to the nations you enslaved; you have become two arenas
of political masquerade, two Pandora's boxes spreading vandalism
and plague in the East and superstition and its frenzies in the West.
Through your debasement, nature jeers at the great empire it
destroyed. You are like two mummies, preserved to ornament
nature's triumphal chariot, and to give modern cities a foretaste of
the fate in store for the monuments and woiks of Civilisation.
Nature seems to enjoy raising this hateful society for the pleasure
of destroying it and proving, by this hundredfold repeated fall, the
absurdity of the sciences that control it. Like Sisyphus pushing his
rock up the hill only to have it roll down again as he reaches the
top, Civilisation seems condemned to ascend towards an ideal state
and then fall back just as it can see an end to its misfortunes. The
most wisely considered reforms end in appalling bloodshed . Yet
the centuries pass, the people groan in torment, wai tin g for new
revolutions to plunge our tottering empires into chaos; for they are
destined to destroy each other as long as they continue to trust
philosophy, a science that is the enemy of unitary politics, a mask
for intrigue, and good for nothing but fanning the flames of each
revolution that time brings.
To the disgrace of our philosophers, the seeds of disintegration
that threaten our frail societies are multiplying day by day. Yester­
day academic arguments about equality toppled thrones, altars and

The Theory of th � Four Movements
Civilisation, put to new tests, will fail again. It narrowly avoids
death every century: it was in its death-throes when the Turks were
besieging Vienna and would have died if the Turks had adopted
the European tactic. In our own time it has been within a hair's
breadth of ruin: the revolutionary war could have led to the invasion
and dismemberment of France, after which Austria and Russia
would have shared Europe between them; in the subsequent argu­
ments, Russia (which has means unknown to the world and to itself)
would have been able to crush Austria and Civilisation. The destiny
of this criminal society is to shine for a few centuries and then
become eclipsed, to rise again and then to fall once more. If the
civilised order could make human beings happy, God would have
an interest in saving it and would have taken steps to ensure that it
was indestructible. So why does he allow your societies to be
engulfed by revolutions when they have only lasted a short time?
In order to confound your writers and thinkers, who base social
theories on their own caprices, while God, with less vanity than the
philosophers, does not regulate the laws of the universe in accord­
ance with his own wishes, but in all his works reconciles those with
the eternal arbiter of justice, mathematics; its truth is independent
of God and yet he follows its laws rigorously.
Do not be surprised, therefore, if your societies destroy each
other, and do not hope for any stability under laws that derive from
man alone, from sciences opposed to the divine spirit that will lead
to the establishment of unity on the globe as in the firmament. Is
not a world with no unitary leader and no central government like
a universe with no God to direct it, where the stars revolve with no
fixed orbits, colliding into each other for perpetuity? For, to a wise
man, your nations look like wild beasts in a ring, eager to destroy
each other and each others' works.
When you lament the successive downfall of your societies, you
forget that they were opposed to God's design. Now that the dis­
covery of his plans has been announced, you must instantly have been
disabused about the excellence of Civilisation, and must have realised
that it has exhausted human patience, and that a new social order is
needed to lead us to happiness; that if we are to adopt God's plans we
must find a social order that is applicable to the whole earth, not just
to the corner of it occupied by civilised man, and that we therefore

Third Part: Problems of the civilised mechanism
need to study the social vices ofthe human race, not just those of Civilis­
ation, which accounts for only a part ofhumanity.
On this basis let us state the argument for the political infirmity
of the globe.
The earth is shared among three societies, Civilisation, barbarism and
savagery. One of the three is necessarily better than the other two. The
two less developed societies, which do not improve and do not identify
with the best of the three, are the victims of that disease of listlessness
which Montesquieu rightly described as a.fflicting the human race.
As for the third society, which is supposed to be the best, but which
cannot or will not encourage the others to imitate it, it is clearly inad­
equate to improve the lot of mankind since it leaves the majority of it
languishing in a state inferior to its own.
As a result, two of the three present societies have become paralysed,
and the third is politically powerless. Can you say, after that, to which
ofthe three societies these morbific characters, which have visibly affected
the social mechanism of the whole globe, should be apportioned?
Discussing this argument, you will recognise the two paralysed
societies as Savagery and Barbarism, which do nothing to improve
their situation and obstinately stagnate in their customs, good or
bad. As for Civilisation, that is the one affiicted with political
powerlessness: it is constantly in movement, trying new measures
every day in its attempt to escape its discomforts.
In passing from savage inertia to barbarous and civilised industry,
humans have thus passed from a state of apathy to one of active
misery, for the savage does not complain about his lot or try to
change it, whereas civilised man is never content, constantly gnawed
by desires despite being surrounded by opulence.
He burns with an uncurable fire,

product of wisdom and yet have done nothing but perpetuate pov­
erty and destruction, perhaps you should try sciences dictated by
folly, as long as they diminish these frenzies and relieve people's
misery.'
You promised happiness but instead you have reduced man to
the level of the beasts. Animals may sometimes lack for necessities,
but they do not have the anxiety of providing for their wants before
they feel them. The lion is well-clothed and well-armed and takes
its food where it finds it without having the worry of looking after
a family and taking measures to guard against future uncertainties.
Its lot is far preferable to that of the shameful numbers of the poor
who crowd your cities, impoverished workers deprived of jobs, har­
assed by creditors and bailiffs, subjected to one humiliation after
another until they finally turn to begging and parade their sores,
their nakedness and their starving children through your cities,
which resound with their doleful laments. Philosophers, these are
the bitter fruits of your sciences: poverty and more poverty. Yet
you claim to have achieved the perfection of reason, when all you
have done is lead us from one abyss to another. Yesterday you
denounced the fanaticism of St Bartholomew's Day: today the pri­
sons of the September massacres denounce you; yesterday it was
the crusades that depopulated Europe: today equality is the cause
that mows down three million young men, and tomorrow some
other fantasy will bathe the civilised empires in blood. Treacherous
thinkers, you have reduced man and society to a state of utter abjec­
tion! The governments you praise so highly do well to be suspicious
of your aid! You have always inspired terror, even in the sovereigns
you counted as your disciples. Sparta cast you out and Cato wanted
you hounded out of Rome. In our time, Frederick the Great said
that if he wanted to punish one of his provinces he would give
them to the philosophers to govern, and Napoleon has banished
politics and ethics from the temple of the useful sciences. And do
you still not distrust yourselves? Will you not admit that in your
manipulation of the passions you have been like children playing
with fireworks amidst barrels of gunpowder! The French Revol­
ution has set the final seal on this truth, and covered your sciences
with a disgrace that can never be expunged.
You knew that these absurd sciences would be destroyed the
moment they were assailed by doubt, and so you have united to

stifle the voices of the few who set out to tell the truth, such as
Hobbes and Rousseau, who saw in Civilisation an inversion of
nature's wishes, a systematic development of all the vices. You
spurned these rays of light in order to win an audience for your
boasts about social improvement.
The scene is changing, and the truth you pretend to be seeking
is about to appear and overwhelm you . There is nothing for you
to do but die honourably, like defeated gladiators. Prepare the heca­
tomb you owe to truth, seize the torch, set up the stake, and consign
the rubbish of your philosophical libraries to the flames.

Omitted Chapter
On organic Movement and compound
counter-Movement
Considerations of time obliged me to exclude a number of chapters,
including the one that follows, despite the fact that I had mentioned
them in the course of the work. I shall restrict myself here to giving
some idea of the first of them.
I said that the substances of the three realms represent the effects
of the passions within the social mechanism: let me give you some
examples of this, beginning with the particular subject of this work,
association.
In the animal kingdom association finds a practical hieroglyph in
the figure of the beaver, and a visual hieroglyph in that of the pea­
cock. The eyes that bestrew the peacock's tail are the emblem of
the magnificence and the inequality of the societary order. This
sequence of eyes ranged in progressive order denotes the fact that
association has nothing to do with our philosophers' dreams of
equality and levelling.
But why does it have such an unbearable cry? Why this contrast
between such superb plumage and such an unpleasant voice? It is
because its voice depicts individual action, which is mendacious
and discordant. The plumage, as emblem of the societary order, is
charming and attractive, but since animals have no social qualities
in themselves, only in association with the works of man, God uses
the peacock's cry to depict the duplicity of every individual, outside
progressive association.

282

Omitted chapter
The extreme ugliness of its feet is another enigma: why are they
not decorative like the pigeon's or the eagle's? Why have two
hideous supports to bear so much luxury? Because the societary
order and the opulence that will result from it rests on two ages of
poverty. (For the two ages of subversion or incoherence, see the
large table at page 42. )
I shall not say much about the peacock here, since this hieroglyph
is difficult to interpret without knowing the laws of Social Move­
ment. Let us turn instead to a figure which is easier to understand,
that of truth and its effects in Civilisation. Let us examine whether
God has faithfully depicted the sad fate of truth in our social state.
The hieroglyph of truth in the animal kingdom is the giraffe.
Since the characteristic of truth is to surmount error, the animal
that represents it must be able to raise his head higher than all the
others: this the giraffe can do, as it browses on branches 1 8 feet
above the ground. It is, in the words of one ancient author, 'a most
fine animal, gentle and agreeable to the eye '. Truth is also most fine,
but as it is incapable of harmonising with our customs, its hiero­
glyph, the giraffe, must be incapable of helping humans in their
work; thus God has reduced it to insignificance by giving it an
irregular gait which shakes up and damages any burden it might
be called upon to bear. As a result we prefer to leave it to inaction,
j ust as nobody will employ a truthful man, whose character runs
counter to all accepted customs and desires. Truth is only beautiful
in our society when it is inactive, and the giraffe, by analogy, is
only admirable when it is at rest: when it walks or runs it provokes
jeers, as truth provokes jeers when it takes a practical form. If a
man were to go to a party in high society and speak out openly and
truthfully about the escapades of the fine ladies there, or about the
shady dealings of the businessmen or other men in the salon, there
would be an outburst of indignation, and all present would agree
in remaining silent about it and reviling the speaker. Matters are
much worse in politics, where truth has even less play: thus to
represent the way truth is repressed, God has cut the giraffe's horns
down to their roots, so that they are no more than sprouts, perma­
nently unable to branch up into antlers; God's chisel has cut them
off at their base, in the same way as, in our society, the chisel of
authority and public opinion has cut down truth to its mere emerg­
ence, forbidding it to develop further. Yet even the most deceitful

The The01y of the Four Movements
among us still want to seem truthful, and although we are enemies
of truth, we want to deck ourselves out in its dress: by analogy, the
only thing we want from the giraffe is its dress, its skin, which is
extremely beautiful; so when we catch one we treat it rather as we
treat truth . We say to it, 'Poor beast, you are good for nothing but
to remain in the desert, far from the society of man; we may admire
you for a little while, but in the end we must kill you and keep
only your skin, just as we stifle truth and keep only its outward
appearance. '
From this explanation w e can see that God has created nothing
without a purpose, even the giraffe which is supremely useless, but
as God was obliged to represent all aspects of our passions, he had
to use this animal to depict the complete uselessness of truth in
Civilisation. If you wish to know what purposes truth will serve in
societies other than Civilisation, study this problem in the counter­
giraffe, which we call the reindeer, an animal which provides us with
every service imaginable: you will see that God has excluded it from
those social climates, from which truth will also be excluded for as
long as Civilisation lasts.
And when the societary order has enabled us to become adept
at the use of truth and the virtues which are excluded from our
lives at present, a new creation will provide us, in the anti-giraffe,
with a great and magnificent servant whose qualities will far surpass
the good qualities of the reindeer, which so excites our envy and
arouses our anger at nature for having deprived us of it.
The most interesting way to approach the explanation of these
hieroglyphs is by looking at contrasts, like those between the beehive
and the wasps' nest, or the elephant and the rhinoceros, at alliances,
like those between the dog and the sheep, the pig and the truffle,
or between the donkey, the thistle and the goldfinch, and by looking
at progression by analysing entire families, like that of horned crea­
tures - giraffe, red deer, fallow deer, roe deer, reindeer etc. - which
are all hieroglyphs of the different effects of truth; and finally by
comparing three families from the three kingdoms.
There would be no point in Civilised man trying to make sense of
the hieroglyphs without understanding the theory of interpretation,
because some of them represent the effects of passions which do
not yet exist. For instance, the diamond and the pig are hieroglyphs
of the thirteenth passion (harmonyism), which the inhabitants of

Omitted chapter
Civilisation have no experience or understanding of. There are
other hieroglyphs, too, which depict social effects unknown in the
civilised order: the elephant, for example, is the hieroglyph of
Primitive Society (Confused Series). This was a state of association
which included the unity of industrial action, figured by the trunk.
This unity was solely based on good food or the luxury of the
mouth: the elephant therefore has no luxury except at its mouth,
whence issue its ivory defences or supports. In its garb it is the
poorest of animals, because the Confused Series had no manufactur­
ing industry, and almost no jewellery, although they were desper­
ately fond of adornment; this is what God represented by covering
the hieroglyphic animal in mud while giving him a disproportionate
fondness for ornamentation.
The idea that the elephant might be more valuable than civilised
man may cause an outcry, but primitive society was indeed better
than our own, in that it possessed the elephant's proud and touchy
sense of honour, a kind of honour which could never for a moment
be in sympathy with the meanness of Civilisation. Primitive society
was a shining example of friendship, fidelity, propriety, gratitude,
and all the elephant's virtues, virtues which are unable to germinate
in our societies; and, by analogy, the elephant ceases to be able to
breed when it becomes part of our society.
Let me add to the analogy between the three kingdoms and the
passions by giving an example drawn from the anatomy of the
human body, which is a general table of the combined order. Let
us look first at the human skeleton.
Its central section is composed of twelve pairs of ribs, leading to
the three bones of the sternum, providing us with an emblem of
the twelve passions which, in both sexes, lead to the three foci of
attraction. There are 7 combined ribs and 5 incoherent ribs, just
as there are seven dominant spiritual passions in the combined
order, and five material passions which are dominant in societies of
the incoherent order; a thirteenth rib, the clavicle, surmounts the
7 combined ones and figures the thirteenth passion, harmonyism,
formed from the 7 spiritual passions . As this passion is destined to
be the principal lever of societary industry, the clavicle has to be
united to the arm, which is the lever of bodily industry.
The same order is partially reproduced in the skull, because the
brain, b e i n g the seat of the soul and the focus of spiritual Move28 5

The Theory of the Four Movements
ment, needs to be housed within a container analogous to the
spiritual passions. The cranium is thus formed of 8 bones, 7 of
which are covered up; the eighth or frontal bone is the only one
visible, and it figures the passion of harmonyism, which is of a
higher order than the 7 primitive passions.
Other parts of the skeleton represent the industrial arrange­
ments of the phalanx of attraction. I have said, for example (see
Note A), that this is organised as a parade of 1 6 choirs and 32
quadrilles, a pattern which is represented by the parade of the
teeth, which are naked and ranged in 1 6 pairs. The last two
pairs are late to appear, weak and of little use, by analogy with
the two choirs I and 1 6 (babies and patriarchs), which are the
two choirs subject to weakness and uselessness. There are thus
14 choirs and 28 quadrilles remaining active and useful, and
these are depicted by the 14 pairs of bones in the hand, which
is the agent of industrial Movement.
These images of the combined order are repeated in all the solids
and fluids of the human body. For example the 800 muscles of the
male and female body provide an emblem of the 800 characters
needed to make up a phalanx of attraction. The IO pairs of nerves
provide an emblem of the IO pubescent choirs, the tenth of which
is outside love and passionate equilibrium; which is why the tenth pair
of nerves wanders about without leading to a fixed place. If anat­
omists had been aware of the laws of Movement they would not
have laid so much stress on the wandering of this tenth pair, which
is a necessary consequence of analogy (just as physicists would not
have spent so much time arguing over whether or not light was a
compound body).
Other more interesting images are presented by the heart, the
liver, the viscera, body-fluids, etc. Many people have felt that
the human body is an epitome of universal Movement, and this
will be convincingly shown to be the case when this system of
comparision has been extended to the smallest anatomical details.
The horror that now surrounds the dissection of cadavers will
then vanish, to be replaced by admiration of the way the body
is constructed as a perfect image of the play of the passions and
the social mechanism.
Civilised man has already caught a sl1perficial glimpse of a few
of these images: the serpent, for example, has been recognised as
286

Omitted chapter
an emblem of the calumnies and treachery of Civilisation, and the
rose and its thorns as an emblem of virginity. These pictures are
too striking to be misunderstood, and should have led to a suspicion
that the image of the passions might extend to the whole of nature.
A reading of this volume will encourage the perception of some
more, such as that of the ugly caterpillar that changes into a beauti­
ful butterfly, which is obviously the emblem of disgusting Civilis­
ation metamorphosed into universal harmony. But for the most part
people will not be able to make sense of the study of hieroglyphs
until I have provided them with the Theory: until then they will
j ust bring the preconceived philosophical ideas of moderation and
equality to their study of them, which will prevent them from per­
ceiving anything of the system of nature. They will imagine, for
example, that the bee-hive represents equality. But this is quite
wrong: the bee-hive and its contrary, the wasps' nest, depict the
political orders of harmony and Civilisation. The bees figure all the
phalanxes of the globe united under the protection of the federal
monarch, whose emblem is the queen-bee, who communicates with
each cell. The drones figure unproductive activity, the congresses
and intermediary agencies which are subordinate to the federal hier­
archy and which the phalanxes can revoke. By analogy, the worker
bees kill the drones when they no longer have any use for them.
This whole mechanism is depicted in reverse in the wasps' nest,
which is the hieroglyph of political order in Civilisation.
To make the image an exact one, these two insects must demon­
strate the opposed consequences of the combined order and the
incoherent order.
Wealth and poverty. These are figured for the bees by honey,
I.
and for the wasps by the useless substance that results from
their immense labours, image of our prodigious industry and
the poverty which is all it gives rise to.
2. Social enlightenment and- social ignorance. These are figured for
the bees by wax, a source of light, and by their domestic associ­
ation with man. Among the wasps we see emblems of ignorance
and social disharmony in the fearful revolution in which the
wasps' nest is self-destroyed, in its position underground,
hidden from the light, and in their hostility to man, whom
wasps attack for no reason, harrying and wounding us, and
entering our rooms to soil and devour our food, and killing our

The Theory of the Four Movements
allies the bees. Bees, by contrast, do us no harm except in
self-defence, and steal nothing from us, as they live off the
scent of flowers, and make themselves doubly attractive by the
example of work and the idea of social harmony they arouse in
our minds whenever they visit our flowers.
When these images of the passions have been explained in their
full detail across the three kingdoms, we shall see the philosophers
capitulate unconditionally in the face of this Theory of Social
Movement which they want to attack before they even understand
it. They will have to admit that nature is not, as the scholars claim,
hidden beneath a veil of brass, but that prejudice has covered our
minds in a triple veil, composed of metaphysical, political and moral
dreams, all of whose claims will be dispelled when we finally possess
the secret of the system of nature which represents the passions,
and we can put it forward in its entirety in support of the Theory
of Social Movement.

288

Note A
On the Progressive Series or Series of
industrial groups
I need to forestall one objection that is bound to be raised against
this new domestic order I have called Progressive Series. It will be
said that a child could have discovered it, and that the whole organ­
isation of the order seems like a game; but this does not matter, as
long as it achieves its purpose of producing industrial attraction and
using the lure of pleasure to involve us in agricultural labour, which
at present is a torment for a well-born man. All its tasks, such as
ploughing, quite rightly fill us with a disgust bordering on horror,
and an educated man with no resources except a plough is reduced
to suicide. This revulsion will be completely overcome by the
powerful industrial attraction produced by the Progressive Series I
am about to describe.
The fact that this order's organisation rests on such simple calcu­
lations is remarkable evidence of the beneficence of providence in
designing the science most important to our happiness to be the
easiest for us to acquire. To attack the Theory of Progressive Series
for its extreme simplicity results in two inconsistent attitudes,
namely criticising providence for making the calculus of our desti­
nies so easy, and criticising civilised man for his stupidity in failing
to see the simplest and most useful of calculations. If a child could
have worked it out, our scholars are less able than children, because
they have failed to discover what their feeble understanding
required; this is indeed the general weakness of Civilisation, whose
thinkers have such inflated scientific pretensions that they overshoot
289

The Theory of the Four Movements
their mark by a factor of ten and make their science so complicated
that they are quite incapable of grasping the simple processes of
nature.
There is no more striking example of this than the case of the
stirrup, such a simple invention that any child could have disco­
vered it: yet it was not invented for 5 ,000 years. In antiquity, riders
became completely exhausted and suffered serious maladies for the
lack of stirrups, and stone blocks had to be placed at intervals along
all the roads to help them mount. When they hear this, everybody
is amazed at the stupidity of the ancient world, and yet this stupid­
ity lasted fifty centuries, even though any child ought to have been
able to prevent it. You will soon realise that the human race has
been equally stupid in relation to the Passional Series, whose simple
calculus could have been discovered by anyone with the slightest
learning. Now that it has at last been understood, any criticism of
its simplicity will, I repeat, be a joke which rebounds on those who
make fun of it, and on the twenty-five centuries of scholars who
have failed to perceive it.
Let us move on to the explanation I have promised . I shall deal
only with material organisation of the Series, and say nothing here
about their relations.
A Progressive Series is composed of people who are unequal
in every way: in age, fortune, character, understanding, etc. Its
members must be chosen so as to provide a contrast and grad­
ation of inequality, from rich to poor, learned to ignorant, etc.
The more these inequalities are graduated and contrasted, the
more the Series will involve itself in profitable work, and provide
social harmony.
It will be divided into different groups, organised in the same
way as an army. In order to give a picture of it, I shall assume a
mass of about 600 persons, half men and half women, all drawn by
their passions to a single branch of industry, such as the cultivation
of flowers or fruit. Let us take, as an example, the Series devoted
to pear growing: the 600 people will be subdivided into groups,
each of which will specialise in the cultivation of one or two types
of pear, with one group of sectaries of the butter-pear, one of sectar­
ies of the bergamot, one of sectaries of the russet, and so on. When
everybody has enrolled in the group of their favourite pear or pears
(they may be members of more than one group), there will be some

thirty groups, with different banners and decorations, which will
form three or five or seven divisions, as in the table above. It does
not matter whether the Series is composed of men or women or
children or a mixture of each, the arrangement is always the same.
The Series will always have approximately this arrangement both
in the number of its groups and in the division of its work; the
closer it approaches to this symmetry in its gradations, the more it
will be in harmony with and involved in its work. The canton with
the best graduated and most contrasted Series will be the one that
makes the largest profit and, everything being equal, achieves the
finest produce.
If the Series is symmetrically formed, like the one I have just
described, there will be alliances between the divisions which corre­
spond to each other. The ascending and descending wings will ally
themselves against the centre and strive to outdo the centre in the
quality of their produce; the two wingtips will join together with
the centre to compete with the wings . The result of this mechanism
will be that each group, through emulation, produces magnificent
fruit.
Similar rivalries and alliances will occur between the different
groups within a division. If a wing is composed of six groups,

The Theory of the Four Movements
three of women and three of men, there will be industrial rivalry
between the men and the women, rivalry within each sex between
group 2, which is central, and the two outside groups, I and 3,
which will be in league against it, and an alliance of the groups
in No. 2, both men and women, against the claims of the male
and female groups in I and 3; finally all the groups of the wing
will form an alliance against those of the wingtips and the centre,
so that a Series which is simply devoted to the cultivation of
pears will have more federal and competitive intrigues than all
the political cabinets of Europe.
Then there are similarly organised intrigues between Series, and
between cantons. There will, understandably, be great rivalry
between the pear-growers' Series and the apple-growers' Series; but
the pear-growers will form an alliance with the cherry-growers'
Series, as the two species of fruit trees are too different to provoke
jealousy among their cultivators.
The more the passions, struggles and leagues between the
Series of a canton can be aroused, the more they will compete
in their enthusiasm for work, and the more they will perfect the
branch of industry their passions incline them towards. This will
result in the general perfection of all industry, as Series can be
formed for every branch of labour. What about [ambiguous]
hybrid plants like the quince, which is neither a pear nor an
apple? Its group is placed between the two Series, so that it
becomes a link between them. The quince group is the forward­
position of the pear-growers' Series, and the backward-position
of the apple-growers' Series. It is a mixed group in between two
Series, a transition between the two incorporated into both of
them. And, just as there are these mixed products which belong
to no species, so there are bizarre or hybrid tastes in the passions.
The societary order utilises all these eccentricities and finds a
use for every imaginable passion, God having created nothing
that does not have a purpose.
I have said that the Series cannot always be classified as
symmetrically as the one I have just described, but they approxi­
mate as closely as they can to that system, which is the natural
order, and the best way of exciting the passions, counter­
balancing them, and drawing them into work. As soon as workers
are organised into progressive Series, work itself becomes a pleas-

Note A
ure, and they work less for the lure of profit than as a result of
competition and other processes inherent in the spirit of
the Series [and in the development of the Cabalist, or tenth,
passion] .
This gives rise to a most astonishing result, as astonishing as
all those in the societary order, namely that the less people are
concerned with profit, the more profit they will make. In fact,
the Series most stimulated by intrigues, the one that makes the
most pecuniary sacrifices to satisfy its pride, will be the one that
imparts the greatest perfection and value to what it produces,
and consequently makes the largest profit by forgetting self­
interest and being entirely absorbed in passion . If, however, a
Series has little in the way of rivalry, intrigue and alliances, little
pride and excitement, it will work for its own interests rather
than out of its particular passion, and its product, like its profits,
will be greatly inferior to those of a Series with plenty of intrigue.
The more it is stimulated by love of profit, in short, the less
profit it will make. [It is therefore necessary to organise intrigue
in a grouped Series as symmetrically as in a drama; and if this
is to be successful, the most important rule to follow is the
graded distribution of inequality. ]
A s I have already said, if Series are t o have maximum intrigue
and if the products of each of their groups are to be as perfect
as they can be, they must be co-ordinated, as far as possible,
with the ascending and descending progression. In order that
readers may more easily fix this arrangement in their minds, I
shall provide a second table, this time illustrating the parade
Series.
Parade Series

In a societary canton all the members of the industrial phalanx
that cultivates the canton are divided into 1 6 choirs of different
ages; each choir is composed of 2 quadrilles, one of men and
one of women, making a total of 32 quadrilles, 16 male and 1 6
female, each with its distinctive banners, decorations, officers and
costumes, both for winter and summer. The r6 choirs are classi­
fied in the following order, making up the 7 divisions I described
above .

The choirs to 1 5 are the nine amorous choirs; the sixth choir
has already reached puberty but does not practise love materially,
only spiritually.
In a parade, the 32 quadrilles appear in 32 different uniforms;
women always make up half the organisation of the societary order.
The arrangement of the Series is the same in all branches of
agricultural and manufacturing industry, and in science, art and
pleasure. There is always a symmetrical competition between
groups and the divisions made up of several groups.
By using the tables I have provided, anyone will be able to classify
a Series of science or arts and divide each type into the seven div­
isions of centre, wings, etc., [which can themselves be subdivided
into various types) .
If five groups of poets practise the following five genres:
2 94

Note A
Epic
Tragedy
Comedy
Ode
Idyll
everyone should be able to indicate which division of the Series
they belong to and classify them as follows.
The

Ode group in the ascending wingtip.
Tragedy group in the ascending wing.
Epic group in the centre of the Series.
Comedy group in the descending wing.
Idyll group in the descending wingtip.
the hybrid genres in the forward or backward-position.

In addition to the seven divisions I have indicated, a complete Series
also has five accessory divisions, namely:

Reserve.
Novices.
Al/sorts.
Sectines.
Auxiliaries.

The Reserve is composed of individuals who previously belonged
to one group in the seven genre divisions, but whose tastes have
changed so that they have abandoned that passion. Their help is
sometimes called for in situations where an unforeseen mishap
endangers the work of the Series or diverts a majority of its mem­
bers from a necessary gathering.
The Novices are those who have a budding passion for the tastes
of the Series and aspire to join one of its groups. They are taken
on provisionally as pupils, after which they can move to the level
of bachelors, and from there to full membership of the Series.
The Al/sorts are a group whose members have a general knowl­
edge of all the branches of industry or pleasure that the Series com­
prises. For example, in the Series of flowers there will be some
members who will want to understand how to grow all the varieties
of flowers, so that they will be able to take part in all the functions
of all the groups in the Series. They will make up the group of a
2 95

The Theory of the Four Movements
thousand flowers which cultivates the meadow altars, around which
all kinds of flowers will be planted. They will preside over exhi­
bitions, and will have other, additional functions.
The Sectines" are the branches of sectsb which are subdivided into
various groups too small to have officers and the usual organisation .
The sectine of small flowers would be one, made up of some twenty
small groups of three or four individuals who will specialise in the
cultivation of unimportant small flowers, like pansies, daisies,
mignonette and heliotrope, little flowers which will not produce
coalitions of Series members such as we shall see in the case of
carnations, roses, tulips, ranunculus, hyacinth, tuberose and others
for which there will be many more uses which will call for the
classes of officers I shall describe below.
Assuming that fifty lovers of small flowers form a dozen little
groups, they will join together in three main groups in order to
take their place in the large Series of flowers. There they will form
the descending wingtip, and from their twelve little groups they
will establish the seven divisions I described in relation to the pear­
growers' Series.
The Auxiliaries. In simple Series, composed of one sex only, the
auxiliary body is a group of the opposite sex which is linked to the
Series. Although some tasks are assigned to one sex in particular,
there will be some men whose passions incline them to occupations
which are normally allotted to women, and some women whose
inclination leads them to prefer men's work. This apparent eccen­
tricity is part of the general law of exception which nature intro­
duces everywhere. Every simple Series thus has links with one or
two auxiliary groups, drawn from the opposite sex, so that each
individual can find an outlet for the passions that God has given
them. When the Series is compound or made up of both sexes, its
auxiliaries will also be drawn from both sexes.
The twelve divisions will have a large number of officers, the six
principal classes of which I shall describe. 1
" The small diets which make up the large one are called dietines; I have coined
the word 'sectines', by analogy, to describe the small sects I am describing here.
' Remember that Sect means the same as Series [editors' note, 1841 ].
' 1 84 1 : 'seven principal classes'. Fourier adds a combined officer class, and includes
Saints and Patrons in the Academy, which becomes class seven.

Officers.

From this table, in which the officers outnumber the soldiers, it
will be clear how important it is to control and graduate the
inequalities of fortune in a phalanx of harmony, and to bring
together every sort of contrast, from the millionaire to the man with
no fortune, from the scholar to the uneducated, etc.; without these
contrasts it would not be possible to form the corps of officers, who
are the soul of each Series.
The Divinities. Each group elects a divinity of the opposite sex.
A male group chooses a goddess, a female group chooses a god;
then there are divinities for each division in the Series, like the god
or goddess of the ascending wing or the centre, etc., and divinities
for the Series as a whole.
In festivities and ceremonies each god or goddess takes their place
at the head of their group, division or Series, taking precedence
over all the other officers (we are talking about festivities, not about
work); thus for example a Series of woodmen or woodcutters, made
up of fifteen [male] groups, will appear on its feast-day with a corps
of divinities arranged as follows:

Then some Cherubs and Seraphs drawn from among the children
to serve the gods and goddesses.
The Hamadryads will be chosen from the young women, the
Dryads from the middle-aged women, and the Fairy, the Sibyl and
other first-class deities from the ranks of the old women, who have
already passed through the lower grades.
If the Series is compound, i.e. made up of both sexes, the corps
of olympians will be twice as large.
2 97

The Theory of the Four Movements
The gods take their place at the altar and receive divine honours
from the Series.
The position of divinity does not require any knowledge of the
occupations of the Series. A young woman might be chosen to be
Urania for a group of astronomers without having any understand­
ing of astronomy. It is enough for the god or goddess to have some
rough idea of the work of the group whose worship they receive.
Gods are usually chosen from the class furthest removed from the
group. A society of very rich scholars (as scholars will be in the
combined order) will happily choose a poor girl as their goddess,
and this choice will become her path to fortune. A group of mostly
poor workers will often choose one of the phalanx's rich women for
their divinity. These contrasts are dictated by sentiment, without
any need to explain the motives behind them.
The Priesthood. The priests and priestesses in a Series are the
principal musicians: they conduct the hymns and the divine service
in the temple or at parades. There must be at least one priest or
priestess attached to each group, with senior priests for the divisions
of the Series and a high priest or priestess for the Series as a whole.
The priesthood is twice the size for compound Series.
The Senior Officers. This is composed of more or less the same
superior officers as a military regiment, namely a captain, lieutenant
and sub-lieutenant for each group, and officers of the Series, such
as the colonel, major, banneret, etc.
The Non-commissioned Officers are again comparable to regimental
NCOs. Each group has its standard-bearer, its corporal and other
deputies, under the command of the Series NCOs who inspect
them. They are responsible for equipment.
[The Combined Officers comprise the corresponding negotiators,
both in the Phalanx Treasury and in the neighbouring phalanxes
and the provincial and regional Congresses.]
I do not need to add that if the Series is compound, there will
be twice as many officers, of both sexes. A compound Series will
thus have a male and a female colonel, and a male and a female
banneret. The women perform all the functions of their offices
instead of merely being invested with meaningless titles, like our
Madam President who presides over nothing, and Madam Field­
Marshal, who commands nobody. In the combined order, where
there will not be any marriage, people will not acquire the rank of

Note A
the men or women they sleep with; the only titles they will have
will be those of the jobs they do: if a woman is nominated as colonel
or banneret of the flowers, she will command the Series in parades
or carry its banner, and take the chair in meetings related to its
tasks. A female paladin will command the female caravans, and a
female marshal will command the women's army.
The Administration. This is composed of officers with responsi­
bility for accounts and ceremonial, such as the conservator, archi­
vist, herald and mace-bearer, etc. Each group has to have officers
like this, and others will be appointed for the whole Series, which
needs a male or female conservator and herald, as does each group
and each division of the Series.
The Academy. Its membership is drawn from the leading experts
in each group, those who have the greatest theoretical or practical
knowledge. A Series of 12 groups will thus have 24 academicians,
half theorists, half practitioners, drawn from each of the groups,
with a few extra members chosen for the breadth of their ideas.
The academy makes decisions relating to the interests of the Series
as a whole, and arbitrates on the undertakings of individual groups.
There can be other kinds of officers in the Series, in fact they can
be multiplied ad infinitum: a child who is admitted to thirty or so
Series may have some twenty ranks and give himself a grand title
longer than that of the king of Spain.
[The Saints or Patrons and Patronesses. This body is made up of
dead men and women who have brought fame to the Series and
furthered the progress of science or the arts. After their death they
are beatified and canonised by the Council of the Spheric Hierarchy,
special division. Buffon, for example, will be canonised by the
universal Series of zoologists, Linnreus by that of the botanists,
Hippocrates by the doctors, Duhamel by the fruit-growers, Racine
by the dramatists. Their statues will be honoured in perpetuity, all
over the globe, by their own Series, as part of a religious cult which
will inspire each Series, in recognition of the services they have
rendered to it, to perpetual gratitude.]
All this pomp may be thought unnecessary to the cultivation of
flowers and fruit, wheat and wine, etc., but baubles and honorific
titles do not cost anything, and they are incitements to greater
enthusiasm in the work of the Series. Captains are only captains
during parades, and for the rest of the time they work like anybody
299

The Theory of the Four Movements
else, as all the members of a progressive Series are there out of
attraction and a taste for the passion of the Series. In a gastronomy
Series, for instance, the colonel and the captains will eat as well as
the ordinary members, and the same goes for their work which, in
the combined order, will be as much of an attraction as the table
and other pleasures are for us. And if each of the twenty members
of a group is given an official function, this will merely intensify
activity and competition without costing a penny more, apart from
expenditure on their ornaments of office, since, as the Series is
passionate about the purpose for which its members have come
together, the officers do not receive any emoluments and are quite
content with the dual motivation of the passion which drew them
into the Series and the rank which distinguishes them. It is suf­
ficient reward for the richer officers to be able to spend money at
will for the good of the Series, without any thought of profit,
although profit there will be at the end of the year; in fact, the less
they think about it, the greater it will be, and the more it will be
helped by the zeal with which their enthusiasm inspires the subal­
tern members of the Series.
Easy as it is to understand the organisation of the Series, it will
be commensurately difficult to grasp their mechanism without a full
treatise on the subject. The difficulty lies not in forming them, but
in setting them in action and inciting them to work by means of
inter-·group and inter--divisional leagues and rivalry.
The only way in which the passionate Series can become involved
in work is through the influence they can exercise collectively over
each other. It will be necessary to form 1 44, twelve dozen, in order
to set them working in proper accord by means of rivalry and com­
petition. ( 1 44 is intended to be an approximate number.) If only
one or two Series were formed in isolation, there would be no way
of setting them in motion. It would be very easy to set up some
Series of enthusiasts for flower and fruit growing in Paris by provid­
ing them with gardens full of trellises and flowers, conveniently
arranged for the work of the different groups, but after a week the
Series would be all over the place and it would be impossible to
keep them to a single task, even if they were composed of people
who had nothing else to do. The passionate mechanism cannot be
organised incompletely: each part is necessary for the whole, and
the absence of a few cogs would throw the whole machine into
300

Note A
chaos. This why it would not be possible to form a half-phalanx of
sixty or so progressive Series; there is no halfway-house between
harmony and incoherence except a societary order with graduated
passions. (See page u6 on the progressive household or preliminary
Series, the nine-group tribe.)
But by forming a canton, acording to geometrical rules, of about
1 44' Series devoted to agriculture, manufacture, science and the
arts, and by setting them symmetrically against each other, it will
be possible to stimulate such keen intrigues and imbue their work
with so many of the different kinds of self-interest which all the
Series will discover in general attraction, that each will be led on by
the other to perform prodigies of industry and study, without need­
ing to be prompted by the lure of profiL They will have no motive
other than the passionate spirit, a blind prejudice for their favourite
tastes; and this excitement will be so powerful that millionaires, the
sybarites of today, will rise before dawn in order to expedite and
personally to support the work of the Series they have sided with.
You will see them during the day wearing themselves out like
galley-slaves, going around their favourite groups and Series, inspir­
ing them by their example; and even after so much hard work, they
will wish they could make the days twice as long, so that they could
double the fatigue that makes them so happy. All their collaborators,
rich and poor, will share their enthusiasm, which is the reason why
the progressive Series will be able to obtain valuable harvests from
land which resists all the attempts of civilised man to make it fertile.
We saw earlier how, in a canton with a diameter of about 3 ,000
toises' diameter and a population of 1 ,000 to 1 ,200 persons, it will
d
be necessary to form about 1 5o Series with about 300' individuals
in each (this number is approximate).
It is obvious that these

I 50

Series will require

I 50

dominant

passions: each person will thus have to have about a quarter 1 of the
1 50 passions, or nearly 40 dominant tastes, in order to enrol in forty
or so Series.
But civilised man, for the most part, has no more than three or
four dominant tastes, and so it will be necessary for them to develop
' [405 ]
d [405]
' [ 1 00]

I

(a I Oth]
301

The Theory of the Four Movements

a large number of new fantasies, and to create in each individual
at least ten times as many passions as he has today. To attain this
goal it will be necessary to proceed by methods contrary to all our
received wisdom, but this does not matter, so long as we arrive at
our purpose, which is to produce industrial attraction so that people
can perform with pleasure all the agricultural and manufacturing
tasks which today are only performed out of necessity and with
loathing.
This brief note will not shed any light on the problem of how
to manoeuvre the 1 44 Series of a canton into inveigling each other
into domestic, manufacturing and agricultural labour, and into
studying and practising the arts and sciences, and ensuring that the
products of their industry attain the degree of perfection to be
expected of people who work out of passion, esprit de corps and
self-respect instead of for motives of need and profit.
But it should be clear from this inadequate note that the Theory
of Series is not fitted to abridgement, and cannot be properly
explained by an outline sketch . It is based on procedures so far
removed from anything we are accustomed to that it requires a full
understanding, and mere summaries and anticipatory ideas of the
sort that people ask me for will not cast any light on the terrifying
problem of transposing the human race into industrial attraction. I
shall provide the solution to this in the third memorandum. The
first two will be taken up with preparatory discussions, particularly
on the necessity of association as the only order compatible with
God's intentions.
In order to organise a regular and stable social mechanism, God
could not speculate on individuals acting in isolation, only on societ­
ary groups, for the following reasons:
God cannot wish his works to be subject to continual disorganis­
ation and instability, which is what would happen if their fate rested
with isolated individuals who suffer from the weakness of being
subject to death and inconstancy: he must rather choose passionate
groups or corporations, which never die and whose tastes never
vary, as those whom death or inconstancy remove are constantly
replaced by fresh neophytes. Groups improve endlessly because
they are immortal; they transmit the skills and lessons of experience
from one age to the next in a way that cannot happen in families,

3 02

Note A
because children do not inherit their fathers' tastes and do not have
the ability to continue and improve their fathers' work.
The civilised order ought to demand a degree of conformity of
taste between fathers and sons, or at least a less striking divergence
between them, but in fact the opposite happens, and nature takes
a delight in dividing them as sharply as it can, putting the poetic
genius of Metastasio in the son of a door-keeper, and endowing the
offspring of one great mang with the most vulgar inclinations. This
disparity, which has such a harmful effect on our domestic society,
is one of the thousand indications of its opposition to nature's
designs: nature made characters and passions to suit the combined
order, not to suit civilised incoherence. I shall frequently have
occasion in the course of this work to repeat that, once the progress­
ive Series have been organised, you will find that some natural dis­
positions which today strike you as eccentric or vicious will turn
out to be admirable: fathers will congratulate themselves that their
children have been given tastes different from their own, and the
human race will praise God for creating inclinations that, in your
Civilisation, are the seeds of profoundest disorder, and you will
come in the end to recognise that there are no bad or useless pas­
sions, and that all characteristics are good in themselves, that all
passions must be intensified, not moderated; that we need to create
fantasies and needs even among the rich; that the best citizens, those
most useful to the societary mechanism, are those with the greatest
inclination towards the refinements of sensual pleasure and those
who are most blindly devoted to assuaging all their passions. This
is the unimaginable problem whose solution is to be found in the
Theory of progressive Series or Series of industrial groups.

partners for them. I mention this omission, as one among many, to

Advice to the civilised
About the coming social metamorphosis
A number of civilised people have wanted to know what they should
do to make the best use of what remains of Civilisation: here is
what I have to say in this connection.
I . Do not erect any buildings. The arrangement of civilised
buildings is quite incompatible with life in the combined order, and
all your houses will require enormous changes if they are to be of
any use; some, indeed, will be completely unusable. There is no
need for property-owners to be alarmed at this, because any damage
caused by the establishment of the new order will be indemnified
by the Spheric hierarchy, which will have three times as much
empty land as cultivated; and when the whole of the globe has been
brought into production, it will have ten times more wealth than
it needs to cover any indemnities that arise.
2. Seek out portable wealth such as gold, silver, precious metals
and gems, and other luxury objects scorned by the philosophers:
their value will double or triple in the period when the combined
order begins. Copper, tin, iron, etc., will not increase so markedly,
but generally speaking all products that have to be arduously mined
from the earth will rapidly acquire great value in the combined
order, where mining will be extremely expensive because it so unat­
tractive a job. The same will be true of objects extracted from the
sea-bed with such difficulty, like pearls, etc.: very few people will
undertake work of this sort, even once harmony has been completely
established.

The Theory of the Four Movements
3 . In country properties, the best things to look for are full-grown
timber woods and quarries. A vast number of new buildings will
have to be constructed very quickly, so building timber and ashlar
are bound to become extremely expensive in the early years, when
the combined order will still be imperfect, and the mercantile spirit
will continue more or less intact for some time.
4. Do not set up house in some distant place, and certainly do
not be tempted to go abroad in search of fortune: everyone will be
happy in their own home region, and will have no misgivings about
staying there. As for emigration from the more populous countries,
this will take place in a very different manner from your present
colonial system, and colonists will set off already formed into phal­
anxes to occupy cantons and buildings which will have been pre­
pared for them by industrial armies.
5. Have children: there will be nothing more valuable at the start of
the combined order than little children of three and under as, not
having yet been spoiled by civilised education, they will receive the
full fruits of natural education and develop body and mind to perfec­
tion. Consequently, a child of two will be much more valuable than
one of ten, and the Spheric hierarchy will generously compensate all
young women who can provide children under the age of three. Simi­
larly it will compensate princes who take steps to encourage this by
allowing all young women to have children outside wedlock.
6. Do not sacrifice present well-being to future happiness. Enjoy
the moment, avoid any association of marriage or interests which
does not instantly satisfy your passions. Why should you work for
some future good, when it will surpass anything you could wish for,
and when the only annoyance you will feel in the combined order
will be your inability to double the length of the days to make
enough time for the immense round of pleasures you will have
available?
7. Do not be misled by superficial people who think that the
invention of the laws of Movement is just a theoretical calculation.
Remember that it only requires four or five months to put it into
practice over a square league, an attempt which could even be com­
pleted by next summer, with the result that the whole human race
would move into universal harmony, so your behaviour should be
governed from now on by the ease and proximity of this immense
revolution.

Advice to the civilised

8. Be even more careful not to listen to criticisms which have to
do with the inventor rather than the invention. What does it matter
how it is announced? Or that this prospectus is lacking in style and
method, etc . ? I freely admit it, and indeed I have no intention of
trying to do better in the memoranda that will follow . Even if they
were written in dialect, it is the invention you should judge, not the
inventor. Any criticism is thus beside the point, as the invention has
not yet been published, and I have allowed nothing but a few
glimpses of it. It was probably not necessary to devote a whole
volume to such an announcement, but I had to bow to public opi­
nion, which wants volumes. The first question anybody asks is how
many volumes the invention will take up; they seem to believe that
nothing can have any value unless it has filled several, so I have to
embroider the subject a bit and write books which are fairly bad, as
befits a man who, apart from his discovery, knows nothing except
how to handle a yardstick. So, to save the critics time, let me declare
that I offer my books to the slaughter, and lay no claim to being a
writer, only an inventor. I have no desire even to read a grammar
to correct the faults with which, I am sure, my style is teeming. I
parade my ignorance because the greater it is the more shame it
casts on scholars who, with all the knowledge I lack, have been
unable to discover the laws of social Movement, and have failed to
glimpse the way to happiness that I, and I alone, have opened to
the human race, nobody else being able to claim the slightest share
in my invention.
Before I publish it, I shall produce a second prospectus which
will be an extension of this one, dealing with more or less the same
subjects.
The purpose of these two memoranda being to sound out public
opinion in order to know what points require more extensive devel­
opment, I have had to skim lightly over all the matters I have
touched on, as I cannot provide a more thoroughgoing demon­
stration before I publish the theory of passionate attraction.
This will be contained in six small memoranda which will appear
one after another, and in which I shall describe the combined order
in action. I shall assume that Epimenides will reawaken in the year
2200, the period when the eighth social period will have developed
into its full splendour, and when the second creation will begin,
leading the human race into the ninth period.

The Theory of the Fou r Movements

Subscribers to these six books about passionate attraction will be
able to send me their objections and their comments on develop­
ments they consider necessary. I shall give them clarifications which
will be of general use and, as each book comes out, I shall devote a
few pages to answering what seem to me to be the most important
points raised by readers. Apart from this, I have no desire to engage
in any polemical argument on the subject.
There is one problem that people will have to abstain from asking
for clarification about: this is the most important of all, the problem
of the proportional remuneration of the three aspects of industry, that is
to say, the division of the agricultural and manufacturing products of a
phalanx among its members in proportion to the capital, knowledge and
labour of each .

This problem is the Gordian knot of the combined order, and
without a solution to it there is no point in organising a phalanx; it
would rapidly fall into disharmony if nobody knew the measures
necessary for the proportional remuneration of the three aspects. I shall
deliberately avoid clarification of this problem so that I can retain
the honour of founding universal harmony myself, as it could be
initiated by any rich landowner, or even a company of shareholders,
if I divulged the solution to this problem.
I ask you now to re-read this work if you want to derive any
benefit from it: a first reading will not suffice for such a new subject;
and, besides, not being used to writing I have not been able to
classify the various matters systematically, or explain them clearly.
A second reading will therefore dispel many of its obscurities and
make up for my inadequacies. A number of my assertions run coun­
ter to all received opinion and may at first offend the intelligence;
they can only be appreciated at a second reading: the first reading
will only provoke doubts which will have to be fully confirmed by
a maturer consideration of the absurdities of Civilisation.
Has there ever been a more favourable moment to recall civilised
man to a sense of shame at himself and his philosophic sciences?
Has there ever been a generation more politically inept than the one
which has caused the death of three million young men merely to
bring about a return of the prejudices it wanted to be free of? The
frenzies of earlier centuries were far more excusable: greed and
fanaticism displayed themselves quite openly and it was naked
passion that caused wars; whereas nowadays the worst massacres in
3 08

Advice to the civilised

historical memory are perpetrated for the honour of reason, and
three million victims are sacrificed for sweet equality and tender fra­
terni�y, after which Civilisation, tired of carnage and ashamed of its
own ineptitude, sees no other path to peace than meekly to re­
establish the prejudices they had banished, and to seek support from
customs which the philosophers accuse of irrationality.
These are the political triumphs of the present generation. After
that, who will not blush to be civilised and to have given credence
to political and moral charlatanism? What century should be more
prepared to regard our knowledge of society as dark ignorance, and
to suspect the existence of some more definitive science that has so
far evaded the researches of the human race? For indeed the science
of social happiness you have failed to find is none other than the
theory of passionate attraction; the mechanism of attraction is a
problem which God gives all globes to solve, and their inhabitants
cannot move on to a state of happiness until they have had it
explained to them . 1

The Advice concluded with the following advertisement:
SUBSCRIPTION. The six memoranda on Passionate Attraction will each comprise
about one hundred and fifty pages of the same nature and format as this volume,

Introduction

Fourier wrote the following piece, the New Introduction to the
Theory of the Four Movements, in 1 8 1 8, ten years after the work's
first publication, and four years before the publication of the Treat­
ise on Domestic and Agricultural Association, which the author was
preparing at the time. It was printed in Fourier's lifetime in La
Phalange, vol. 1 , number 22, in 1 837.1

Reading this work, you must try to avoid the mistake all the French
make: they want a prospectus to contain all the details which prop­
erly belong in a treatise, and complain that they cannot understand
how the changes I announce will be put into practice. If I had
wanted to explain this I would have published a treatise, not a pros­
pectus. It is not appropriate to begin by publishing my Theory;
and as I have only published the announcement of it, I do not need
to provide anything except a few glimpses to excite curiosity and
create a demand for the treatise in which the practical means will
be communicated.
My purpose in publishing this book was twofold: to test public
opinion and to prevent plagiarism. It was a way of staking my claim,
a measure particularly necessary in France where twenty plagiarists
l ay claim to every discovery and accuse the author himself of
plagiarism.
I cast this essay in a form that was sometimes shocking, and
varied its tone, in order to disguise the different tests I was making
' Note taken from the edition of 1 84 1 .

I8J8 Introduction

of readers' preconceived ideas, which are stronger in France than
anywhere else. The most convenient way of examining these one
by one was to arrange the work after the manner of Harlequin's
costume, stitching it together from all sorts of motley materials. It
has been accused of being unsystematic, but it has the kind of
method necessitated by disguise.
The first part of the work, the Cosmogony, is not definitive,
although it contains many details which have been confirmed by
the definitive Theory. It was not until 1 8 14 that I discovered the
Universal Keyboard of Creation, which operates as a compass in
this kind of calculation.
In the Treatise I shall publish in 1 82 1 , this part of the work will
be definitive, like the rest. I have corrected the most glaring errors
by hand. But on the whole there are very few errors of conjecture
on this issue; indeed I am amazed that I made so few mistakes when
I did not have the verification calculations I discovered in 1 8 1 4.
A few examples will suffice to demonstrate how slight these
errors are. In the large table I set the number of social periods at
32: it is, in fact, 34, including the two pivotal periods which do not
count as Movement. I omitted all the pivots in 1 807. I estimated
the number of our planets at about fifty, including those as yet
undiscovered. This was a more serious error. There are only 32 in
the solar scale, not including our moon, Phoebe, which is a dead
star and will be replaced by the small star Vesta.
There are only two more planets in the scale which remain to
be discovered: these are Proteus, which is hidden by Saturn, and
Sappho, which is hidden by Herschel; both are of the composite
order, and correspond in terms of function to Venus and Mars.
There may also be four reserve planets beyond Herschel, but this
will still only bring the total number in the vortex to about 40
instead of 50. I was not able to make a proper count of these
unknown planets when I set the total approximately at 50.
An equally serious error of method was to divide Movement into
four branches instead of five: one pivotal and four cardinal branches.
I was unaware of the Theory of Pivots in 1 808, and frequently
omitted them. This irregularity does not change anything as far as
the foundations of the general Theory are concerned, any more than
my overlooking the neutral mode, which is not mentioned in this
volume, as I only discovered its uses six years later.
311

The Theory of the Four Movements
The wits who made jokes about the Four Movements would have
been better employed in correcting these errors. They could have
demonstrated to me that I had forgotten the Aromal Movement,
and that I had mistakenly situated the passional on the line of the
four others, when it is their Pivot and their model.
No new science can be complete at the first attempt, especially
when its author is the only person working on it. In 1 807 I had
only known about it for eight years, and there were still an infinite
number of problems to be solved before I had a complete body of
doctrine. I would not have hurried into print so quickly if the curi­
osity of several individuals had not asked me for at least an outline
of it, and urged me on because of their fear of the censorship that
was threatened, and which muzzled France the following year. To
avoid it, I hastily composed this essay.
I had already solved some of the principal problems, including
the formation of the Passional Series and the organisation of a Phal­
anx of domestic harmony with 8 1 0 contrasting characters. And I
already knew the secret of balanced distribution as a direct function
of masses and an inverse function of the square of distances.
It was thus possible, from then on, to leave Civilisation. The
French have preferred to remain there, at a cost so far of 1 ,500,000
lives lost in battle, and every sort of humiliation and destruction.
The list of these disasters is the best response to their jokes, for
which they have been so thoroughly punished.
The discussions I have had about my discoveries with indiyiduals
from other nations have persuaded me that the French, with their
mania for wit, their many preconceived ideas and their habit of
dogmatising about every debate without analysing it first, are not
competent to study Attraction, whereas the Germans and other
northern peoples understand it very well. They are not so full of
inflated pretensions and can adapt themselves to the precept of Con­
dillac and Bacon, who both advise Civilised man to remake his under­
standing and forget everything they have learned about the inexact
sciences.
The study of Passional Attraction is the most important illus­
tration of this precept, but as the French are not the kind of people
to take it to heart, it is not possible for them to familiarise them­
selves with the New Science, which runs counter to all their precon­
ceived ideas, and requires that they be abandoned. Besides, neither
312

1818 Introduction
they nor anybody else can judge it on the basis of a prospectus
limited to a few glimpses without the complete Theory and prepara­
tory argument.
The Paris journals, while admitting that these arguments are
well-constructed and logically developed, have responded in the
usual French way with mockery; but mockery is not refutation. And
I might, anyway, pay them back in their own coin, since they only
allow mockery, by congratulating them on the wonderful benefits
they have received from Civilisation in the period since I showed
them the way out of it, by having to pay for its prolongation with
so much blood and money. I think the laugh is on them.
Anybody who reads this book in that French spirit, with that
mania for superiority and for disparaging a living compatriot, will
only be fooling himself. I shall demonstrate this by showing two
opportunities for profit and honour that the discovery presents to
France, limiting myself to two out of a hundred.
1 . Opportunity for profit. This has to come first to fit in with the
tone of our mercantile century.
France is burdened by an enormous debt which, by 1 820, will
have reached four billion, as the legislative body has admitted.
Would it not be useful if France could transfer this debt to the
global account?
But England also has a debt, of 1 8 billion; let us say 20 billion
at the first default, and an annual premium of 1 billion. We know
how much the people are crushed by this affliction. What appalling
images of beggary arise from that country's statistics, now burdened
with an additional communal tax of 200 million for poor relief! Eng­
land would thus have more to gain than France from seizing the
means of liberating itself from it, without it costing them a penny;
for now the trial organisation of Harmony is established on the basis
of new procedures which exempt the sovereign from any risk or
expense. At this rate, how could England hesitate to start a trial
the success of which would free her of her colossal debt, and ensure
her a host of material savings which will be mathematically
demonstrated?
But if England takes the initiative in this trial, as the weight
of her debts inevitably requires that she should, this will be a
major embarrassment for France, who could have seized this
advantage, this escape from debt, for herself, merely by treating
313

The Theory of the Four Movements
its inventor with the respect due to a man who is not asking for
premature trust, only for the examination and trial of his Theory
at no expense by any sovereign with 500,000 subjects, like the
ruler of Darmstadt?
The sceptics will reply that they do not know how the author
will put it into practice. But how can you know this on the basis of
a prospectus written in 1 807 when the principal development of the
Theory took place between 1 8 1 4 and 1 8 17 ? These regularise and
complete the Science and the way it will be taught. Nothing else is
needed to make it a success except to devote all the necessary time
to putting together the Treatise, and to support it with a list of the
interest that each sovereign, each nation, each rich man has in put­
ting the initiation of harmony to a simple test.
2. Opportunity for honour. The French have been accused of being
undeveloped where genius is concerned, of being incapable of
invention, only of improvement. If they wanted to absolve their
country of this criticism, they would be flattered that one of their
countrymen has thrown down the gauntlet to the whole world of
learning with the claim that Newton and Kepler, who believed that
they had discovered the laws of Movement, only revealed the fifth
branch, and that a Frenchman was about to unveil the other four.
After this announcement they should give my Theory provisional
protection, conditional upon my providing a complete Treatise,
fully compatible with experience, and applicable to the definitive
sciences and to positive knowledge.
But the French think quite otherwise. All they see is the trivial
pleasure of making fun of a fellow-countryman, attacking him in
the name of rhetoric, when what they ought to be doing is forming
a judgement of his inventiveness and waiting for the explanatory
Exposition.
This will not be an easy task to fulfil . The first part of the body
of doctrine has just taken me sixteen months, during which time I
have only roughed out a third of the book. Admittedly this was the
thorniest part and the one with the largest quantity of problems:
the rest is less difficult, and will take me two years to complete,
which I can do by a fixed date in 1 820, or 1 82 1 including a year for
revisions and corrections.
If I then publish an adequate Treatise in which the discovery of
the integral laws of Movement is fully set out, French scholars will

1818 Introduction
be profoundly embarrassed to realise that they have practically
deified the discoverer of the fifth branch, the partial discoverer
Newton, who is indeed worthy of the highest honour, whereas their
compatriot, the discoverer of the integral laws comprising all five
branches of Movement, has received nothing from them but mock­
ery, discouragement and annoyance, to such an extent that he has
withdrawn to another country to publish it. I shall move abroad in
1 819.
France will then try, a s usual, t o claim the honour fo r this dis­
covery, just as it claims the discovery of vaccination, the steamship
and everything else, down to Rumford soup. 2 There seems to be
nothing they do not lay claim to. Detraction and plagiarism go
together; they want to ridicule inventors and then claim credit for
the inventions. I shall give them the lie; I shall show that they have
done nothing but work to discourage me, and that if I had given in
to their sarcasm and insinuation, I would have given up my research
and the world would have been deprived of the integral Theory of
Movement.
Those who have stood out against the general response, prefer­
ring to wait for the Treatise before condemning the inventor, will
understand how foolish it is to judge an invention before it has been
published, and to j udge it on the basis of an incomplete prospectus,
published when the Theory was only halfway to the state it is in
today.
And what kind of critical judgements have they made? They
could not say anything about the way the Theory was to be put into
practice as I have not communicated this, so they have attacked the
style and the method. As if the style mattered in reporting discover­
ies! Surely if a man is announcing a new and immensely useful

discovery, like the nautical compass, it does not matter if he writes
in dialect, as long as he delivers the desired benefit of an effective
means of orientation in darkness and in mines?
It is a failing of our century, especially in France, to require

The Theory of the Four Movements
oratorical talents for everything, when there is only a limited
number of purposes for which they are useful . There is only one
thing to be demanded of me: a complete Theory of the art of
developing and integrating all the passions into a Phalanx of 1 44
Passional Series, modulated through the 8 1 0 characters of the uni­
versal keyboard. This is the only problem I have set myself, and it
is the only one I have to solve. Even if I published it in dialect,
my responsibility would be discharged. Will philosophy have any
comparable merit? Has it solved a single one of these problems,
from collective ones like Social Happiness and the Unity of Nations
to partial ones like the eradication of poverty, fraud, etc.? It has
failed in all of them, for all its paraphernalia of style and method
and the rest. Other weapons are therefore required to force Nature
to reveal her secret.
This will be fully revealed in the Treatise on Integral Movement,
or the five divisions, to wit: the Passional, or Model, which is the
Pivot of the four Cardinal Movements, the Instinctual, the Aromal,
the Organic and the Material or Newtonian. Until the appearance
of the Treatise which will present them within a unitary framework,
if you want to gain any benefit from reading this announcement
you must remember:
1 . That any weaknesses of style or method are insignificant in
the case of an inventor, because the only thing that can be asked
of him is a useful discovery. There is a surfeit of useless sophisti­
cation in our society: wit and rhetoric are to be found everywhere.
Anybody who is providing something scientifically useful like the
Theory of Social and Passional Unity should dispense with frippery
of that sort;
2. That the inventor in this case is all the more exempt from
oratory, since he is used to commerce and is a stranger to arts and
letters. It is all the more commendable of him to have braved criti­
cism and humiliation by using his own methods to reveal the inven­
tion with which destiny has favoured him;
3. That since the most exact science, mathematics, has only been
developed by degrees, one can hardly demand that one book should
initiate and explain a new science. Readers must be content with
what is obviously the seed of a discovery, a seed which is more
than amply described in this prospectus, where there are plenty of

1818 Introduction

indications of a secret extracted from nature, which our philosophic
sciences, which suppress nature, have failed to see;
4. That ten years have passed since this prospectus was written,
in which period the Theory has been developed so much, especially
in 1 8 14, that the author can promise, without boasting, to provide
a very satisfactory body of doctrine in less than three years;
5. Finally that, far from seeking the approbation of the French,
the author intends neither to deal with them nor to publish in
France. It would be a serious mistake to think he was trying to
proselytise on the basis of this incomplete outline, now withdrawn
from circulation, which he only published reluctantly, in order not
to seem disobliging.
These are the factors that should be considered by detractors and
sceptics. Impartial judges need only be reminded of the distrust to
which the French mind too easily gives way in its scorn for compat­
riots. If I had signed myself Fourington instead of Fourier, all
Frenchmen would have hailed me as a sublime genius who would
transcend Newton by removing the whole veil, when that great man
only understood how to raise a corner of it. Let us pass over this
national failing and reassure well-intentioned readers by giving
them a token of success drawn from the ease with which the Theory
can be put into practice.
There are 3,000 candidates for fortune or power, each of whom
can institute a trial of the Phalanx of Harmony, and thereby become
hereditary monarch of the globe. This is a title which bears no
relation to that of the partial Sovereigns governing each Empire, as
the sceptre will be conferred by the Spheric hierarchy upon the
individual who manifestly will have achieved the deliverance of the
globe and its attainment of its social destiny by establishing the first
experimental canton of Harmony.
Each of these 3 ,000 candidates can claim this eminent position
by establishing a canton, which will be very financially lucrative, at
a cost of one-quarter of the sum they spend so prodigally and use­
lessly every day in dubious speculation, vanity or even in necessary
expenditure which Harmony will render superfluous, such as
almsgiving.
For example, in England, a single branch of charity - the public
assistance given to the poor - annually absorbs eight million

The Theory of the Four Movements
pounds, or 200 million French francs. The cost of the poor is one
of the many burdens we could be free of if we allocated as little as
half a million French francs to form the nucleus of a subscription
for the establishment of a trial canton of Harmony.
Let us move on and look at some individual examples of prodi­
gality and waste.
In Vienna in 1 8 1 7 Marialva spent 1 million florins (2,400,000
francs) on a wedding: if he advanced a quarter of that on a guarantee
of land on which to establish Harmony, he would become hereditary
monarch of the globe. And remember that advancing money is not
the same as spending it, and that the founder and shareholders of
a canton of Harmony are as well covered as if they were lending
against securities.
They say that Burdett distributed more than half a million francs
when he was trying to get the not very important position of deputy:
he could have obtained the hereditary throne of the world by
advancing the same sum on guarantee as he lost by his expenditure
on the temporary rank of deputy.
Labanoff is having a palace built in St Petersburg that will cost
16 million francs. He could be the hereditary monarch of the globe
by advancing one thirty-second of the sum he will have spent on
a building that will ruin his family, because it will require such a
huge retinue of servants that it will be ruinous, if not for the present
prince, then for his successor.
Similarly crazy enterprises, entailing the loss of millions, can be
found in the commercial milieu of the middle classes. Cabarrus de
Bayonne lost 1 ,300,000 francs when he underwrote the bankrupt
Tassin. If he is prepared to risk over a million for a return of 2 or
3 per cent, he can well afford a guaranteed venture of half a million
on Harmony, which would bring him the throne of the world, and
provide a return on capital of 1 44 to I for him and all his
shareholders.
Some advice to all those who desire both position and profit.
Think how much intrigue is needed to reach the precarious rank
of minister! The throne of the world is open to anybody with
ambition who wants to obtain it, and the undertaking involves no
risk at all .
There is a further detail which should be very attractive to co­
operators. There will be about I 1 5 to 1 20 empires the size of France

18!8 Introduction

to be distributed, as "well as crown kingdoms of varying status, all
of which will take the place of small states that have not formed
alliances, like those in the interior of Africa, which will be given
emperors, and the uncultivated areas which make up three-quarters
of the globe, and which the Hierarchy will prepare for colonisation
only when that can take place as a result of Attraction. The present
method of establishing colonies by wretched emigres driven over­
seas by famine will no longer be practicable in a state of universal
happiness. Colonisation will therefore have to happen as a result
of Attraction, or attractive emigration, which can only be put into
operation by the Spheric Hierarchy, and not by local sovereigns.
The fact that the colonisation and full occupation of the globe will
have to be organised by the Spheric Hierarchy will guarantee that
there will be about 1 20 imperial thrones available for distribution
to anybody who has served the cause of the human race by initiating
or aiding the trial of Harmony in a canton of a thousand inhabitants.
It will be equally rewarding in terms of pecuniary profit. Colonis­
ation, to start at the lowest end of the scale, will produce 4 thousand
billion from the retrocession of colonised territories, which the col­
onist will pay in annuities. With such a large fortune at its disposal,
it will cost hardly anything to cover England's debt, even at double
the size, and, in cases where the sum ass·igned to the operation was
put up by one individual aided by subscribers and co-shareholders,
to repay it at a rate of 1 44 to I .
When these assertions have been arithmetically and incontrovert­
ibly proven, and when it becomes clear that the metamorphosis of
the social world depends on nothing more difficult than a trial Phal­
anx of Harmony, there will be more than enough sovereigns, minis­
ters and individuals vying to start one.
The Tsar Alexander gives 500,000 francs to the poor of Glaris:
he only has to advance the same sum on mortgage to become omni­
arch of the globe. He allocates 60 million to build the church of St
Saviour: he only has to divert 800,000 francs of this to have a
nucleus of shares in the founding canton; then, as well as enjoying
the omniarchate of the globe and having the honour of being the
liberator of the human race, he will also benefit by having the globe
pay double the cost of the church, 120 million, as a return on his
guaranteed · advance of 800,000 francs. And there are many other
splendid motives I could emphasise, but I shall restrict myself to

The Theory of the Four Movemen ts

those related to profit, as they are the only ones which carry any
weight in Civilisation.
There is one danger for weaker souls, a trap about which they
must be forewarned. This is a mistaken sense of shame, fear of
public opinion and harsh criticism, which will continue till the last
moment to mock and attack the founder, claiming he is deluded,
and that it is madness to give credence to a Theory that contradicts
400,000 volumes of philosophical perfectibility, which have given
rise to nothing but poverty and fraud.
Hence the need for a proper system of proof, the need to devote
all available time to it, not to do anything hastily and not to publish
it among the harsh critics of Paris, where columnists only pro­
nounce favourably on authors who have left a pile of gold coins on
their mantelpiece.
Other nations, of course, have their share of human weakness,
particularly vanity, but I have found a means of protection against
them in an attitude which will guarantee the founder against the
shafts of criticism.
This is the line he should adopt:
He should pretend to regard everything pertaining to the Pas­
sional Harmony of Series (not explained in this volume) as suspect
fiction, and list none but purely material advantages, buttressed by
unanswerable arithmetical proofs. These fall into three branches: ( I )
combined agriculture; (2) combined household; and (3) combined
dwellings. These associations, impracticable for ten or twenty famil­
ies, are entirely practicable for 200 families of varied fortune, who
can be regarded as a small town.
The candidate who intends to set up the founding canton should
thus adopt a fashionable disguise - the philosophy of perfectibility and say:
'I do not believe in all the aspects of the Theory, like the pas­
sional unity of the 1 44 Series, and the glamorous concert of 8 1 0
characters arranged i n octaves like a n organ keyboard: that i s all a
flight of fancy on the part of an inventor whose real successes have
gone to his head. But I shall remove from his calculations the part
I suspect of being illusory, and adopt only the material arrange­
ments, which have been mathematically shown to produce a thirty­
fold profit, and the ability to live as comfortably for 1 ,000 francs
in this system of Combined Production as one could for 30,000
francs in Civilisation; the New Industrial Order will also produce
320

1818 Introduction
a host of moral improvements, such as the eradication of poverty,
fraud and theft among the co-operators, prodigious savings of time,
labour, machinery and produce, and a considerable reduction in
the number of maladies inherent in the domestic and industrial
arrangements of people in Civilisation.'
The founder can thereby masquerade as a moral economist, in
order to avoid taking his stand under the banner of an anti­
philosophical inventor who has had the nerve to snatch the greatest
palm from the scholars and make a magnificent discovery in the
heart of what ought to be their province, while the virtuosi of Paris
cudgel their brains in a vain attempt to discover something new.
According to this hypothesis, the Founder would play the role
of a severe critic of my Theory, sifting the good ore from the bad.
By giving some ground to the sceptics, he would bring it into line
with received opinion, presenting himself as the perfector of per­
fectible Civilisation, the man responsible for introducing a new
economic and moral philosophy; after all, it is well known that there
has to be a new one for each generation, just as there has to be a
new almanac each year.
By means of this apparent break with my doctrine of Passions,
the Founder will at once receive more acclaim for my discovery
than I shall myself, and my work will look like Aeneas' dunghill,
out of which a philosophical Virgil has been able to extract some
pearls.
And there is another triumph in store for him. If he really wants
to flatter the Parisian Minotaur, the ideologues' monopoly of the
perfectibility of reason, and the economists' monopoly of the per­
fectibility of commerce, he must declare in his founding manifesto,
that he has taken his plan, not from my Theory, which only con­
siders things superficially, but from the torrents of enlightenment
provided by the economists, and the deep profundities of the ideo­
logues; and to fill the Parisian readers with even more pleasant
expectations, he can assure them that the purpose of the foundation
will be to add new lustre to the philosophy of commerce, and prove
that sensations are created from ideas by the perceptions of intuition
of the cognition of the volition of the good of commerce and the
chartered company.
With a few lines of this fashionable jargon he will be able to
charm all academic hearts, and he will be proclaimed a pillar of
metaphysical soundness, an oracle of the great truths of economic
321

The Theory of the Four Movements
and moral commerce, and the true perfector of the perfectibilising­
ness of perfectible Civilisation.
Meanwhile the good disciple will make his arrangements for set­
ting up the trial of both the material and the passional, at the same
time, with the opportunity for success on both fronts. There will
be no shortage of candidates to gamble on this mask of partial mis­
trust in their attempt to win the universal sceptre, including princes
who secretly bewail the loss of their thrones! What an opportunity
for revenge, as those who dethroned them will become their
subordinates!
It is no exaggeration to say that this approach, and others I have
not described, will attract a thirtieth of the candidates, mo out of
3 ,000. But it will not take mo: one individual will be enough. To
understand the method by which I shall determine which one this
will be, you will have to wait until I have prepared an adequate
Treatise. It is, I repeat, essential not to anticipate success on the
basis of an incomplete prospectus, written before the discoveries of
1 8 14.
You must therefore consider this embryonic work in the same
light as the crude statues of the Egyptians: none of our students
would wish to have made them. Yet they are nevertheless valuable
as the seeds of art, and as an indication of the progress it will need
to make.
By the same token, instead of finding fault with the weak
elements of this book, it would be more prudent to recognise how
surprising it is that after only eight years I have been able to unite
so many parts of the calculation of Harmony, on the basis of two
years' uninterrupted work and a few moments of my spare time. It
is indeed astounding that my contemporaries have not seen indi­
cations in this prelude of a great discovery that ought to be pursued,
an absolutely new Passional Science, the publication of which ought
to have been encouraged by every impartial judge.
