Equality of rights is another chimera praiseworthy when considered in the abstract and ridiculous from the standpoint of the means employed to introduce it in civilisation The first right of men is the right to work and the right to a minimum income This is precisely what has gone unrecognised in all the constitutions Their primary concern is with favoured individuals who are not in need of work
 

Biography

Most of Fouriers mansucripts were published only after his death and the date on which they were written is unknown His first book was the 400 page Theorie des Quatre Mouvements published in 1808 and Fourier sent copies to members of the nobility and bankers The 1400 page Traite de lassociation domestique agricole was published in 1822 later republished as Theorie de lunite universelle Le Nouveau Monde Industriel et Societaire was published in 1829 and each of these published works were only fractions of the manuscripts from which they were taken

Fourierism
Apart from the translation of a few passages from the Quatre mouvements Charles Fourier Theorie des quatre mouvements et des destinies generales on the subject of love there is nothing here that cannot be found in a more complete form in Stein Herr Grun dismisses morality in a sentence which a hundred other writers had uttered long before Fourier
Morality is according to Fourier nothing but the systematic endeavour to repress the human passions  p 147
That is how Christian morality has always defined itself Herr Grun makes no attempt to examine Fouriers criticism of present day agriculture and industry and as far as trade is concerned he merely translates a few general remarks from the Introduction to a section of the Quatre mouvements  Origine de leconomie politique et de la controverse mercantile pp 332 334 of the Quatre mouvements Then come a few extracts from the Quatre mouvements and one from the Traite de lassociation on the French Revolution together with the tables on civilisation which are already known from Stein The critical side of Fourier his most important contribution is thus dismissed in the most hasty and superficial fashion in twenty eight pages of literal translation and in these with very few exceptions only the most general and abstract matters are discussed the trivial and the important being thrown together in the most haphazard way
Herr Grun now gives us an exposition of Fouriers system Churoa August Ludwig Churoa Kritische Dorstellung der Socialtheorie Fouriers whose work is quoted by Stein long ago gave us a better and more complete version Although Herr Grun considers it vitally necessary to offer a profound interpretation of Fouriers series 139 he can think of nothing better than to quote literally from Fourier himself and then as we shall see later to coin a few fine phrases about numbers He does not attempt to show how Fourier came to deal with series and how he and his disciples constructed them he reveals nothing whatever about the inner construction of the series It is only possible to criticise such constructions  and this applies also to the Hegelian method by demonstrating how they are made and thereby proving oneself master of them
Lastly Herr Grun neglects almost entirely a matter which Stein at any rate emphasises in some measure the opposition of travail repugnant and travail attrayant
The most important aspect of the whole exposition is Herr Gruns criticism of Fourier The reader may recollect what was said above concerning the sources of Gruns criticism He will now see from the few examples which follow that Herr Grun first of all accepts the postulates of true socialism and then sets about exaggerating and distorting them It need hardly be mentioned that Fouriers distinction between capital talent and labour offers a magnificent opportunity for a display of pretentious cleverness one can talk at length about the impracticability and the injustice of the distinction about the introduction of wage labour etc without criticising this distinction by reference to the real relationship of labour and capital Proudhon has already said all this infinitely better than Herr Grun but he failed to touch upon the real issue
Herr Grun bases his criticism of Fouriers psychology  as indeed all his criticism  on the essence of man
For human essence is all in all  p 190
Fourier too appeals to this human essence and in his own way reveals to us its inner core   in his tabulation of the twelve passions like all honest and reasonable people he too desires to make mans inner essence a reality a practical reality That which is within must also be without and thus the distinction between the internal and the external must be altogether abolished The history of mankind teems with socialists if this is to be their distinguishing feature The important thing about everyone is what he understands by the essence of man  p 190
Or rather the important thing for the true socialists is to foist upon everyone thoughts about human essence and to transform the different stages of socialism into different philosophies of human essence This unhistorical abstraction induces Herr Grun to proclaim the abolition of all distinction between the internal and the external which would even put a stop to the propagation of human essence But in any case why should the Germans brag so loudly of their knowledge of human essence since their knowledge does not go beyond the three general attributes intellect emotion and will which have been fairly universally recognised since the days of Aristotle and the Stoics It is from the same standpoint that Herr Grun reproaches Fourier with having cleft man into twelve passions
I shall not discuss the completeness of this table psychologically speaking I consider it inadequate   whereupon the public can rest easy psychologically speaking  Does this number give us any knowledge of what man really is Not for a moment Fourier might just as well have enumerated the five senses the whole man is seen to be contained in these if they be properly explained and their human content rightly interpreted  as if this human content is not entirely dependent on the stage of development which production and human intercourse have reached  Indeed it is in one sense alone that man is contained in feeling his feeling is different from that of the animal etc  p 205
For the first time in his whole book Herr Grun is obviously making an effort to say something about Fouriers psychology from the standpoint of Feuerbach He is obvious too that this whole man contained in a single attribute of a real individual and interpreted by the philosopher in terms of that attribute is a complete chimera Anyway what sort of man is this man who is not seen in his real historical activity and existence but can be deduced from the lobe of his own ear Hegel Vorlesungen uber die Naturphilosophie Einleitung 246 Zusatz or from some other feature which distinguishes him from the animals Such a man is contained in himself like his own pimple Of course the discovery that human feeling is human and not animal not only makes all psychological experiment superfluous but also constitutes a critique of all psychology
Herr Grun finds it an easy matter to criticise Fouriers treatment of love he measures Fouriers criticism of existing amorous relationships against the fantasies by which Fourier tried to get a mental image of free love Herr Grun the true German philistine takes these fantasies seriously Indeed they are the only thing which he does take seriously It is hard to see why if he wanted to deal with this side of the system at all Grun did not also enlarge upon Fouriers remarks concerning education they are by far the best of their kind and contain some masterly observations Herr Grun typical Young German man of letters that he is betrays when he treats of love how little he has learned from Fouriers critique In his opinion it is of no consequence whether one proceeds from the abolition of marriage or from the abolition of private property the one must necessarily follow upon the other But to wish to proceed from any dissolution of marriage other than that which now exists in practice in bourgeois society is to cherish a purely literary illusion Fourier as Grun might have discovered in his works always proceeds from the transformation of production
Herr Grun is surprised that Fourier who always starts with inclination  it should read attraction should indulge in all kinds of mathematical experiments for which reason he calls him the mathematical socialist page 203 Even if he did not take into account Fouriers circumstances he might well have examined a little more closely the nature of attraction He would very soon have discovered that a natural relation of the kind cannot be accurately defined without the help of calculation He regales us instead with a philippic against number a philippic in which literary flourishes and Hegelian tradition are intermixed It contains passages such as
Fourier calculates the molecular content of your most abnormal taste
Indeed a miracle and further
That civilisation which is being so bitterly attacked is based upon an unfeeling multiplication table Number is nothing definite What is the number one The number one is restless it becomes two three four
like the German country parson who is restless until he has a wife and nine children
Number stifles all that is essential and all that is real can we halve reason or speak of a third of the truth
He might also have asked can we speak of a green coloured logarithm
Number loses all sense in organic development
a statement of fundamental importance for physiology and organic chemistry  pp 203 204
He who makes number the measure of all things becomes nay is an egoist
By a piece of wilful exaggeration he links to this sentence another which he has taken over from Hess  see above
Fouriers whole plan of organisation is based exclusively upon egoism Fourier is the very worst expression of civilised egoism  pp 206 208
He supplies immediate proof of this by relating that in Fouriers world order the poorest member eats from forty dishes every day that five meals are eaten daily that people live to the age of 144 and so on With a naive sense of humour Fourier opposes a Gargantuan view of man to the unassuming mediocrity of the men of the Restoration period but Herr Grun only sees in this a chance of moralising in his philistine way upon the most innocent side of Fouriers fancy which he abstracts from the rest
While reproaching Fourier for his interpretation of the French Revolution Herr Grun gives us a glimpse of his own insight into the revolutionary age
If association had only been known of forty years earlier  so he makes Fourier say the Revolution could have been avoided But how  asks Herr Grun did it come about that Turgot the Minister recognised the right to work and that in spite of this Louis XVI lost his head After all it would have been easier to discharge the national debt by means of the right to work than by means of hens eggs  p 211
Herr Grun overlooks the trifling fact that the right to work which Turgot speaks of is none other than free competition and that this very free competition needed the Revolution in order to establish itself
The substance of Herr Gruns criticism of Fourier is that Fourier failed to subject civilisation to a fundamental criticism And why did he fail Here is the reason
The manifestations of civilisation have been criticised but not its basis it has been abhorred and ridiculed as it exists but its roots have not been examined Neither politics nor religion have undergone a searching criticism and for that reason the essence of man has not yet been examined  p 209
So Herr Grun declares that the real living conditions of men are manifestations whereas religion and politics are the basis and the root of these manifestations This threadbare statement shows that the true socialists put forward the ideological phrases of German philosophy as truths superior to the real expositions of the French socialists it shows at the same time that they try to link the true object of their own investigations human essence to the results of French social criticism If one assumes religion and politics to be the basis of material living conditions then it is only natural that everything should amount in the last instance to an investigation of human essence ie of mans consciousness of himself  One can see incidentally how little Herr Grun minds what he copies in a later passage and in the Rheinische Jahrbucher as well he appropriates in his own manner what the Deutsch Franzosische Jahrbucher had to say about the relation of citoyen and bourgeois which directly contradicts the statement he makes above
We have reserved to the end the exposition of a statement concerning production and consumption which true socialism confided to Herr Grun It is a striking example of how Herr Grun uses the postulates of true socialism as a standard by which to measure the achievements of the French and how by tearing the former out of their complete vagueness he reveals them to be utter nonsense
Production and consumption can be separated temporally and spatially in theory and in external reality but in essence they are one Is not the commonest occupation eg the baking of bread a productive activity which is in its turn consumption for a hundred others Is it not indeed consumption on the part of the baker himself who consumes corn water milk eggs etc Is not the consumption of shoes and clothes production on the part of cobblers and tailors Do I not produce when I cat bread I produce on an enormous scale I produce mills kneading troughs ovens and consequently ploughs harrows flails mill wheels the labour of wood workers and masons  and consequently carpenters masons and peasants consequently their parents consequently their whole ancestry consequently Adam Do I not consume when I produce On a huge scale too If I read a book I consume first of all the product of whole years of work if I keep it or destroy it I consume the material and the activity of the paper mill the printing press and the bookbinder But do I produce nothing I produce perhaps a new book and thereby new paper new type new printers ink new bookbinding tools if I merely read it and a thousand others read it too we produce by our consumption a new edition and all the materials necessary for its manufacture The manufacturers of all these consume on their part a mass of raw material which must be produced and which can only be produced through the medium of consumption In a word activity and enjoyment are one only a perverse world has torn them asunder and has thrust between them the concept of value and price by means of this concept it has torn man asunder and with man society  pp 191 192
Production and consumption are in reality frequently opposed to one another But in order to restore the unity of the two and resolve all contradictions one need only interpret these contradictions correctly and comprehend the true nature of production and consumption Thus this German ideological theory fits the existing world perfectly the unity of production and consumption is proved by means of examples drawn from present day society it exists in itself Herr Grun demonstrates first of all that there actually does exist a relationship between production and consumption He argues that he cannot wear a coat or eat bread unless both are produced and that there exist in modern society people who produce coats shoes and bread which other people consume This idea is in Herr Gruns opinion a new one He clothes it in his classical literary ideological language For example
It is believed that the enjoyment of coffee sugar etc is mere consumption but is this enjoyment not in fact production in the colonies
He might just as well have asked Does not this enjoyment imply that Negro slaves enjoy the lash and that floggings are produced in the colonies One can see that the outcome of such exuberance as this is simply an apology for existing conditions Herr Gruns second idea is that when he produces he consumes namely raw material the costs of production in fact this is the discovery that nothing can be created out of nothing that he must have material He would have found set out in any  political economy under the heading productive consumption the complicated relations which this involves if one does not restrict oneself like Herr Grun to the trivial fact that shoes cannot be made without leather
So far Herr Grun has realised that it is necessary to produce in order to consume and that raw material is consumed in the productive process His real difficulties begin when he wishes to prove that he produces when he consumes Herr Grun now makes a completely ineffective attempt to enlighten himself in some small degree upon the most commonplace and general aspects of the connection between supply and demand He does discover that his consumption ie his demand produces a fresh supply But he forgets that his demand must be effective that he must offer an equivalent for the product desired if his demand is to cause fresh production The economists too refer to the inseparability of consumption and production and to the absolute identity of supply and demand especially when they wish to prove that overproduction never takes place but they never perpetrate anything so clumsy so trivial as Herr Grun This is moreover the same sort of argument that the aristocracy the clergy the rentiers etc have always used to prove their own productivity Herr Grun forgets further that the bread which is produced today by steam mills was produced earlier by wind mills and water mills and earlier still by hand mills he forgets that these different methods of production are quite independent of the actual eating of the bread and that we are faced therefore with an historical development of the productive process Of course producing as he does on an enormous scale Herr Grun never thinks of this He has no inkling of the fact that these different stages of production involve different relations of production to consumption different contradictions of the two it does not occur to him that to understand these contradictions one must examine the particular mode of production together with the whole set of social conditions based upon it and that only by actually changing the mode of production and the entire social system based upon it can these contradictions be solved While the other examples given by Herr Grun prove that he surpasses even the most undistinguished economists in banality his example of the book shows that these economists are far more humane than he is They do not demand that as soon as he has consumed a book he should produce another They are content that he should produce his own education by his consumption and so exert a favourable influence upon production in general Herr Gruns productive consumption is transformed into a real miracle since he omits the connecting link the cash payment he makes it superfluous by simply ignoring it but in fact it alone makes his demand effective He reads and by the mere fact of his reading he enables the type founders the paper manufacturers and the printers to produce new type new paper and new books The mere fact of his consumption compensates them all for their costs of production Incidentally in the foregoing examination we have amply demonstrated the virtuosity with which Herr Grun produces new books from old by merely reading the latter and with which he incurs the gratitude of the commercial world by his activities as a producer of new paper new type new printers ink and new bookbinding tools Grun ends the first letter in his book with the words
I am on the point of plunging into industry
Herr Grun never once belies this motto of his in the whole of his book
What did all his activity amount to In order to prove the true socialist proposition of the unity of production and consumption Herr Grun has recourse to the most commonplace economic statements concerning supply and demand moreover he adapts these to his purpose simply by omitting the necessary connecting links thereby transforming them into pure fantasies The essence of all this is therefore an ill informed and fantastic transfiguration of existing conditions
In his socialistic conclusion he lisps characteristically the phrases he has learned from his German predecessors Production and consumption are separated because a perverse world has torn them asunder How did this perverse world set about it It thrust a concept between the two By so doing it tore man asunder Not content with this it thereby tears society ie itself asunder too This tragedy took place in 1845
The true socialists originally understood the unity of consumption and production to mean that activity shall itself involve enjoyment  for them of course a purely fanciful notion According to Herr Gruns further definition of that unity consumption and production economically speaking must coincide  p 196 there must be no surplus of products over and above the immediate needs of consumption which means of course the end of any movement whatsoever With an air of importance he therefore reproaches Fourier with wishing to disturb this unity by over production Herr Grun forgets that over production causes crises only through its influence on the exchange value of products and that not only with Fourier but also in Herr Gruns perfect world exchange value has disappeared All that one can say of this philistine rubbish is that it is worthy of true socialism
With the utmost complacency Herr Grun repeats again and again his commentary on the true socialist theory of production and consumption For example he tells us in the course of a discussion of Proudhon
Preach the social freedom of the consumers and you will have true equality of production  p 433
Preaching this is an easy matter All that has hitherto been wrong has been that
consumers have been uneducated uncultured they do not all consume in a human way  p 432 The view that consumption is the measure of production instead of the contrary is the death of every hitherto existing economic theory  ibid The real solidarity of mankind indeed bears out the truth of the proposition that the consumption of each presupposes the consumption of all  ibid
Within the competitive system the consumption of each presupposes more or less continuously the consumption of all just as the production of each presupposes the production of all It is merely a question of how in what way this is so Herr Gruns only answer to this is the moral postulate of human consumption the recognition of the essential nature of consumption  p 432 Since he knows nothing of the real relations of production and consumption he has to take refuge in human essence the last hiding place of the true socialists For the same reason he insists on proceeding from consumption instead of from production If you proceed from production you necessarily concern yourself with the real conditions of production and with the productive activity of men But if you proceed from consumption you can set your mind at rest by merely declaring that consumption is not at present human and by postulating human consumption education for true consumption and so on You can be content with such phrases without bothering at all about the real living conditions and the activity of men
It should be mentioned in conclusion that precisely those economists who took consumption as their starting point happened to be reactionary and ignored the revolutionary element in competition and large scale industry
The Limitations of Papa Cabet and Herr Grun
Herr Grun concludes his digression on the school of Fourier and on Herr Reybaud with the following words
I wish to make the organisers of labour conscious of their essence I wish to show them historically where they have sprung front  these hybrids  who cannot claim as their own even the least of their thoughts And later perhaps I shall find space to make an example of Herr Reybaud not only of Herr Reybaud but also of Herr Jay The former is in reality not so bad he is merely stupid but the latter is more than stupid he is learned
And so  p 260
The gladiatorial posture into which Herr Grun throws himself his threats against Reybaud his contempt for learning his resounding promises these are all sure signs that something portentous is stirring within him Fully conscious of his essence as we are we infer from these symptoms that Herr Grun is on the point of carrying out a most tremendous plagiaristic coup To anyone who has had experience of his tactics his bragging loses all ingenuousness and turns out to be always a matter of sly calculation
And so
A chapter follows headed
The Organisation of Labour
Where did this thought originated  In France  But how
it is also labelled 
Review of the Eighteenth Century
Where did this chapter of Herr Gruns originate  In France  But how The reader will find out without delay
it should not be forgotten that Herr Grun wants to make the French organisers of labour 140 conscious of their essence by an historical exposition in the profound German style
And so
When Herr Grun realised that Cabet had his limitations and that his mission had been completed long ago  which he had known for a long time it did not of course mean an end of everything On the contrary by arbitrarily selecting a few quotations from Cabet and stringing them together he laid upon Cabet the new mission to provide the French background to Herr Gruns German history of socialist development in the eighteenth century
How does he set about his task He reads productively
The twelfth and thirteenth chapters of Cabets Voyage en Icarie contain a motley collection of the opinions of ancient and modern authorities in favour of communism He does not claim that he is tracing an historical movement The French bourgeois view communism as a suspicious character Good says Cabet in that case men of the utmost respectability from every age will testify to the good character of my client and Cabet proceeds exactly like a lawyer Even the most adverse evidence becomes in his hands favourable to his client One cannot demand historical accuracy in a legal defence If a famous man happens to let fall a word against money or inequality or wealth or social evils Cabet seizes upon it begs him to repeat it puts it forward as the mans declaration of faith has it printed applauds it and cries with ironic good humour to his irritated bourgeois Hear what he has to say Was he not a communist No one escapes him Montesquieu Sieyes Lamartine even Guizot  communists all malgre eux Voila the communist all complete
Herr Grun in a productive mood reads the quotations collected by Cabet representing the eighteenth century he never doubts for a moment the essential rightness of it all he improvises for the benefit of the reader a mystical connection between the writers whose names happen to be mentioned by Cabet on one page pours over the whole his Young German literary slops and then gives it the title which we saw above
And so

Herr Grun
Cabet
Herr Grun introduces his review with the following words
The social idea did not fall from heaven it is organic ie it arose by a process of gradual development I cannot write here its complete history I cannot commence with the Indians and the Chinese and proceed to Persia Egypt and Judaea I cannot question the Greeks and Romans about their social consciousness I cannot take the evidence of Christianity Neo Platonism and patristic philosophy141 I cannot listen to what the Middle Ages and the Arabs have to say nor can I examine the Reformation and philosophy during the period of its awakening and so on up to the eighteenth century  p 261
Cabet introduces his quotations with the following words
You claim foes of common ownership that there is but a scanty weight of opinion in its favour Well then before your very eyes I am going to take the evidence of history and of every philosopher Listen I shall not linger to tell you of those peoples of the past who practised community of goods Nor shall I linger over the Hebrews  nor the Egyptian priesthood nor Minos  Lycurgus and Pythagoras I shall make no mention of Confucius nor of Zoroaster who proclaimed the one in China the other in Persia  this principle

After the passages given above Cabet investigates Greek and Roman history takes the evidence of Christianity of Neo Platonism of the Fathers of the Church of the Middle Ages of the Reformation and of philosophy during the period of its awakening Cf Cabet pp 471 82 Herr Grun leaves others more patient than himself to copy these eleven pages provided the dust of erudition has left them the necessary humanism to do so  that is to copy them  Grun p 261 Only the social consciousness of the Arabs belongs to Herr Grun We await longingly the disclosures about it which he has to offer the world I must restrict myself to the eighteenth century Let us follow Herr Grun into the eighteenth century remarking only that Grun underlines almost the very same words as Cabet

Herr Grun
Cabet
Locke the founder of sensationism observes He whose possessions exceed his needs oversteps the bounds of reason and of original justice and steals that which belongs to others Every surplus is usurpation and the sight of the needy must awaken remorse in the soul of the wealthy Corrupt men you who roll in luxury and pleasures tremble lest one day the wretch who lacks the necessities of life shall truly come to know the rights of man Fraud faithlessness and avarice have produced that inequality of possessions which is the great misfortune of the human race by piling up all sorts of sufferings on the one hand beside riches on the other beside destitution The philosopher must therefore regard the use of money as one of the most pernicious inventions of human industry  p 266
But here we have Locke who exclaims in his admirable Civil Government He who possesses in excess of his needs oversteps the bounds of reason and of original justice and appropriates the property of others All excess is usurpation and the sight of the needy ought to awaken remorse in the soul of the wealthy Perverse men you who roll in riches and pleasures tremble lest one day the wretch who lacks the necessities of life truly apprehend the rights of man Heat him exclaim again Fraud bad faith avarice have produced that inequality of means which by piling on the one hand wealth and vice and on the other poverty and suffering constitutes the great misfortune of the human race The philosopher must therefore regard the use of money as one of the most fatal inventions of human industry  p 485

Herr Grun concludes from these quotations of Cabets that Locke is an opponent of the monetary system  p 264 a most outspoken opponent of money and of all property which exceeds the limits of need  p 266 Locke was unfortunately one of the first scientific champions of the monetary system a most uncompromising advocate of the flogging of vagabonds and paupers one of the doyens of modern political economy

Herr Grun

Already Bossuet the Bishop of Meaux says in his Politics Derived from Holy Scripture Without governments  without politics  an absurd interpolation on the part of Herr Grun the earth with all its goods would be the common property of men just as much as air and light no man according to the original law of nature has a particular right to anything All things belong to all men it is from civil government that property results A priest in the seventeenth century has the honesty to say such things as these to express such views as these And the German Puffendorf whom one  ie Herr Grun knows only through one of Schillers epigrams was of the following opinion The present inequality of means is an injustice which involves all other inequalities by reason of the insolence of the rich and the cowardice of the poor  p 270 Herr Grun adds We shall not digress let us remain in France
Listen to Baron von Puffendorf a professor of natural law in Germany and a Councillor of State in Stockholm arid Berlin a man who in his law of nature and nations refutes the doctrine of Hobbes and Grotius concerning absolute monarchy who proclaims natural equality fraternity and primitive community of goods and who recognises property to be a human institution the result of a distribution of goods by common consent to the end that all and particularly the workers may be assured of permanent possession undivided or divided and that in consequence the existing inequality of possessions is an injustice which only involves the other inequalities in consequence of the insolence of the rich and the cowardice of the poor
And does not Bossuet the Bishop of Meaux the preceptor of the French Dauphin the famous Bossuet recognise also in his Politique tiree de lEcriture sainte  written for the Dauphin  that were it not for governments the earth and all goods would be as common to men as air and light according to the primary law of nature no one has a particular right to anything   all things belong to all men and it is from civil government that property springs  p 486

The substance of Herr Gruns digression from France is that Cabet quotes a German Grun even spells the German name in the incorrect French fashion Apart from his occasional mistranslations and omissions he surprises us by his improvements Cabet speaks first of Puffendorf and then of Bossuet Herr Grun speaks first of Bossuet and then of Puffendorf Cabet speaks of Bossuet as a famous man Herr Grun calls him a priest Cabet quotes Puffendorf with all his titles Herr Grun makes the frank admission that one knows him only from one of Schillers epigrams Now he knows him also from one of Cabets quotations and it is apparent that the Frenchman with all his limitations has made a closer study than Herr Gran not only of his own countrymen but of the Germans as well
Cabet says I must make haste to deal with the great philosophers of the eighteenth century I shall begin with Montesquieu  p 487 In order to reach Montesquieu Herr Grun begins with a sketch of the legislative genius of the eighteenth century  p 282 Compare their various quotations from Montesquieu Mably Rousseau Turgot It suffices here to compare Cabet and Herr Grun on Rousseau and Turgot Cabet proceeds from Montesquieu to Rousseau Herr Grun constructs this transition
Rousseau was the radical and Montesquieu the constitutional politician

Herr Grun quotes from Rousseau
Cabet
The greatest evil has already been done when one has to defend the poor and restrain the rich etc    ends with the words hence it follows that the social state is only advantageous to men if they all of them have something and none has too much According to Herr Grun Rousseau becomes confused and quite vague when he has to answer the question what transformation does the previous form of property undergo when primitive man enters into society What does he answer He answers Nature has made all goods common   ends with the words if a distribution takes place the share of each becomes his property  pp 284 285
Listen now to Rousseau the author of the immortal Social Contract  listen Men are equal by right Nature has made all goods common it distribution takes place the share of each becomes his property In all cases the sole proprietor of all goods is society Listen again  hence it follows that the social state is only advantageous to men inasmuch as they all have something and none has too much Listen listen again to Rousseau in his Political Economy economie ou OEconomie  Morale et Politique The greatest evil has already been done when one has to defend the poor and restrain the rich etc etc  pp 489 490

Herr Grun makes two brilliant innovations firstly he merges the quotations from the Contrat social and the economie politique and secondly he begins where Cabet ends Cabet names the titles of the writings of Rousseau from which he quotes Herr Grun suppresses them The explanation of these tactics is perhaps that Cabet is speaking of Rousseaus economie politique which Herr Grun does not know even from an epigram of Schiller Although Herr Grun is conversant with all the secrets of the Encyclopedia  cf p 263 it was a secret for him that Rousseaus economie politique is none other than the article in the Encyclopedie on political economy
Let us pass on to Turgot Herr Grun is not content here with merely copying the quotations he actually transcribes the sketch that Cabet gives of Turgot

Herr Grun
Cabet
One of the noblest and most futile attempts to establish a new order on the foundations of the old everywhere on the point of collapse was made by Turgot It was in vain The aristocracy brought about an artificial famine instigated revolts intrigued and spread calumnies against him until the debonair Louis dismissed his Minister  The aristocracy would not listen therefore it had to suffer Human development always avenges fearfully those good angels who utter the last urgent warning before a catastrophe The French people blessed Turgot Voltaire wished to kiss his hand before he died the King had called him his friend Turgot the Baron the Minister one of the last feudal lords pondered the idea that a domestic press ought to be invented so as to make freedom of the press completely secure  pp 289 290
Yet while the King declared that he and his Minister  Turgot were the only friends the people had at court while the people heaped blessings upon him while the philosophers overwhelmed him with admiration while Voltaire wished to kiss before he died the hand which had signed so many improvements for the people the aristocracy conspired against him even organised a vast famine and stirred up insurrections in order to destroy him by its intrigues and calumnies it succeeded in turning the Paris salons against the reformer and in destroying Louis XVI himself by forcing him to dismiss the virtuous Minister who would have saved him Let us return to Turgot a Baron a Minister of Louis XVI during the first year of his reign one who desired to reform abuses who carried through a mass of reforms who wished to establish a new language a man who actually tried to invent a domestic press in order to ensure the freedom of the press  p 495

Cabet calls Turgot a Baron and a Minister Herr Grun copies this much from him but by way of improving on Cabet he changes the youngest son of the prevôt of the Paris merchants into one of the oldest of the feudal lords Cabet is wrong in attributing the famine and the uprising of 1775142 to the machinations of the aristocracy Up to the present no one has discovered who was behind the outcry about the famine and the movement connected with it But in any case the parliaments and popular prejudice had far more to do with it than the aristocracy It is quite in order for Herr Grun to copy this error of poor limited Papa Cabet He believes in him as in a gospel On Cabets authority Herr Grun numbers Turgot among the communists Turgot one of the leaders of the physiocratic school the most resolute champion of free competition the defender of usury the mentor of Adam Smith Turgot was a great man since his actions were in accordance with the time in which he lived and not with the illusions of Herr Grun the origin of which we have shown already
Let us now pass to the men of the French Revolution Cabet greatly embarrasses his bourgeois opponent by numbering Sieyes among the forerunners of communism by reason of the fact that he recognised equality of rights and considered that only the state sanctions property  Cabet pp 499 502 Herr Grun who is fated to find the French mind inadequate and superficial every time that he comes into close contact with it cheerfully copies this and imagines that an old party leader like Cabet is destined to preserve the humanism of Herr Grun from the dust of erudition Cabet continues Ecoutez le fameux Mirabeau  p 504 Herr Grun says Listen to Mirabeau  p 292 and quotes some of the passages stressed by Cabet in which Mirabeau advocates the equal division of bequeathed property among brothers and sisters Herr Grun exclaims Communism for the family  p 292 On this principle Herr Grun could go through the whole range of bourgeois institutions finding in all of them traces of communism so that taken as a whole they could be said to represent perfect communism He could christen the Code Napoleon a Code de la communaute And he could discover communist colonies in the brothels barracks and prisons
Let us conclude these tiresome quotations with Condorcet A comparison of the two books will show the reader very clearly that Herr Grun now omits passages now merges them now quotes titles now suppresses them leaves out the chronological dates but meticulously follows Cabets order even when Cabet does not proceed strictly in accordance with chronology and he achieves in the end nothing more than an abridgement of Cabet poorly and timidly disguised

Condorcet is a radical Girondist He recognises the injustice of the distribution of property he absolves the poor from blame  if the people are somewhat dishonest on principle the cause lies in the institutions themselves
Listen to Condorcet who maintained in his reply to the Berlin Academy  It is therefore entirely because the institutions are evil that the people are so frequently a little dishonest on principle
In his journal Social Education he even tolerates large scale capitalists 
Condorcet moved that the Legislative Assembly should divide the 100 millions owned by the three princes who emigrated into 100000 parts he organises education and the establishment of public assistance  cf the original text
Listen to what he has to say in his journal Linstruction sociale  he even tolerates large scale capitalists etc
Listen to one of the Girondist leaders the philosopher Condorcet from the tribune of the Legislative Assembly on the 6th July 1792 Decree that the possessions of the three French princes  Louis XVIII Charles X and the Prince of Conde be immediately put up for sale  they amount to almost 100 millions and you will replace three princes by 100 thousand citizens  organise education and institutions for public assistance
In his report on public education to the Legislative Assembly Condorcet says The object of education and the duty of the political authorities  is to offer every member of the human race the means of satisfying his needs etc  Herr Grim changes the report of the Committee on Condorcets plan into a report by Condorcet himself  Grun pp 293 294
But listen to the Committee of Public Education presenting to the Legislative Assembly on the 20th April 1792 its report on the plan of education drawn up by Condorcet Public education should offer to every individual the means of providing for his needs  such ought to be the first aim of national education and from this point of view it is a duty which justice demands of the political authorities etc  pp 502 503 505 509

By this shameless copying from Cabet Herr Grun using the historical method endeavours to make the French organisers of labour conscious of their essence he proceeds moreover according to the principle Divide et impera He unhesitatingly interpolates among his quotations his definitive verdict on persons whose acquaintance he made a moment ago by reading a passage about them then he inserts a few phrases about the French Revolution and divides the whole into two halves by the use of a few quotations from Morelly Just at the right moment for Herr Grun Morelly was en vogue in Paris through the efforts of Villegardelle and the most important passages from Morellys work had been translated in the Paris Vorwärts long before Herr Grun came upon the scene We shall adduce only one or two glaring examples of Herr Gruns slipshod method of translation
Morelly
Self interest perverts the heart and embitters our dearest ties transforming them into heavy chains which in our society married couples detest and at the same time detest themselves
Herr Grun
Self interest renders the heart unnatural and embitters the dearest ties transforming them into heavy chains which our married people detest and they detest themselves into the bargain  p 274
Utter nonsense
Morrelly
Our soul contracts such a terrific thirst that it chokes in quenching it 
Herr Grun
Our soul  contracts  so furious a thirst that it suffocates itself in order to quench it  ibid
Again utter nonsense
Morelly
Those who claim to control our morals and dictate our laws
Herr Grun
Those who pretend to control our morals and dictate our laws etc  p 275
All three mistakes occur in a single passage of Morelly which takes up fourteen lines in Herr Gruns book In his exposition of Morelly there are also numerous plagiarisms from Villegardelle
Herr Grun is able to sum up all his knowledge of the eighteenth century and of the Revolution in the following lines
Sensualism deism and theism together stormed the old world The old world crumbled When a new world came to be built deism was victorious in the Constituent Assembly theism in the Convention while pure sensualism was beheaded or silenced  p 263
Here we have the philosophic habit of dismissing history with a few categories proper to ecclesiastical history Herr Grun reduces it to its basest form to a mere literary phrase which serves only to adorn his plagiarisms Avis aux philosophes a warning to the philosophers
We skip Herr Gruns remarks about communism His historical notes are copied from Cabets brochures and the Voyage en Icarie is viewed from the standpoint adopted by true socialism  cf Burgerbuch and Rheinische Jahrbucher Karl Grun Feuerbach und die Socialisten and Politik und Sozialismus Herr Grun shows his knowledge of French and at the same time of English conditions by calling Cabet the communist OConnell of France  p 382 and then says
He would be ready to have me hanged if he had the power and knew what I think and write about him These agitators are dangerous for men such as us because their intelligence is limited  p 382
Proudhon
Herr Stein revealed his intellectual poverty in no uncertain way by treating Proudhon en bagatelle  cf Einundzwanzig Bogen p 84 Moses Hess Socialismus und Communismus One needs something more than Hegels old twaddle to follow this logic incarnate  p 411
A few examples may show that Herr Grun remains true to his nature in this section too
He translates  on pages 437 44 several excerpts from the economic arguments adduced by Proudhon to prove that property is intolerable and finally exclaims
To this critique of property which is the complete liquidation of property we need add nothing We have no desire to write a new critique abolishing in its turn equality of production and the isolation of equal workers I have already in an earlier passage indicated what is necessary The rest  that is what Herr Grun has not indicated we shall see when society is rebuilt when true property relations are established  p 444
In this way Herr Grun tries to avoid a close investigation of Proudhons economic arguments and at the same time to rise superior to them Proudhons whole set of proofs is wrong however Herr Grun will realise that as soon as someone else has proved it
The comments on Proudhon made in Die heilige Familie  in particular those stressing that Proudhon criticises political economy from the standpoint of political economy and law from the legal standpoint  are copied by Herr Grun But he has understood so little of the problem that he omits the essential point namely that Proudhon vindicates the illusions cherished by jurists and economists as against their practice with regard to the foregoing statement he produces a set of nonsensical phrases
The most important thing in Proudhons book De la creation de lordre dans lhumanite is his dialectique serielle the attempt to establish a method of thought in which the process of thinking is substituted for independent thoughts Proudhon is looking from the French standpoint for a dialectic method such as Hegel has indeed given us A relationship with Hegel therefore exists here really and does not need to be constructed by means of some imaginative analogy It would have been an easy matter to offer a criticism of Proudhons dialectics if the criticism of Hegels had been mastered But this was hardly to be expected of the true socialists since the philosopher Feuerbach himself to whom they lay claim did not manage to produce one Herr Grun makes a highly diverting attempt to shirk his task At the very moment when he should have brought his heavy German artillery into play he decamps with an indecent gesture First of all he fills several pages with translations and then explains to Proudhon with boisterous literary capiatio benevolentiae attempt to win good will that his dialectique serielle is merely an excuse for showing off his learning He does indeed try to console Proudhon by addressing him as follows
Ah my dear friend make no mistake about being a man of learning  or tutor We have had to forget everything that our school masters and our university hacks  with the exception of Stein Reybaud and Cabet have tried to impart to us with such infinite labour and to our mutual disgust  p 457
As a proof that now Herr Grun no longer absorbs knowledge with such infinite labour although perhaps with just as much disgust we may note that he begins his socialist studies and letters in Paris on November 6th and by the following January 20th has inevitably not only concluded his studies but has also finished the exposition of his 
really complete impression of the entire process

The Development of Utopian Socialism

 
 

Modern Socialism is in its essence the direct product
of the recognition on the one hand of the class antagonisms existing
in the society of today between proprietors and non proprietors between
capitalists and wage workers on the other hand of the anarchy existing
in production But in its theoretical form modern Socialism originally
appears ostensibly as a more logical extension of the principles laid down
by the great French philosophers of the 18th century Like every new theory
modern Socialism had at first to connect itself with the intellectual
stock in trade ready to its hand however deeply its roots lay in material
economic facts 
The great men who in France prepared mens minds for the coming
revolution were themselves extreme revolutionists They recognized no
external authority of any kind whatever Religion natural science society
political institutions  everything was subjected to the most unsparing
criticism everything must justify its existence before the judgment seat
of reason or give up existence Reason became the sole measure of everything
It was the time when as Hegel says the world stood upon its head 1
first in the sense that the human head and the principles arrived at by
its thought claimed to be the basis of all human action and association
but by and by also in the wider sense that the reality which was in contradiction
to these principles had in fact to be turned upside down Every form
of society and government then existing every old traditional notion
was flung into the lumber room as irrational the world had hitherto allowed
itself to be led solely by prejudices everything in the past deserved
only pity and contempt Now for the first time appeared the light of
day the kingdom of reason henceforth superstition injustice privilege
oppression were to be superseded by eternal truth eternal Right equality
based on Nature and the inalienable rights of man 
We know today that this kingdom of reason was nothing more than
the idealized kingdom of the bourgeoisie that this eternal Right found
its realization in bourgeois justice that this equality reduced itself
to bourgeois equality before the law that bourgeois property was proclaimed
as one of the essential rights of man and that the government of reason
the Contrat Social of Rousseau came into being and only could
come into being as a democratic bourgeois republic The great thinkers
of the 18th century could no more than their predecessors go beyond the
limits imposed upon them by their epoch 
But side by side with the antagonisms of the feudal nobility
and the burghers who claimed to represent all the rest of society was
the general antagonism of exploiters and exploited of rich idlers and
poor workers It was this very circumstance that made it possible for the
representatives of the bourgeoisie to put themselves forward as representing
not one special class but the whole of suffering humanity Still further
From its origin the bourgeoisie was saddled with its antithesis capitalists
cannot exist without wage workers and in the same proportion as the mediaeval
burgher of the guild developed into the modern bourgeois the guild journeyman
and the day laborer outside the guilds developed into the proletarian
And although upon the whole the bourgeoisie in their struggle with the
nobility could claim to represent at the same time the interests of the
different working classes of that period yet in every great bourgeois
movement there were independent outbursts of that class which was the forerunner
more or less developed of the modern proletariat For example at the
time of the German Reformation and the Peasants War the Anabaptists and
Thomas Munzer in the great English Revolution the Levellers
in the great French Revolution Babeuf 
These were theoretical enunciations corresponding with these
revolutionary uprisings of a class not yet developed in the 16th and 17th
centuries Utopian pictures of ideal social conditions in the 18th century actual communistic theories  Morelly and Mably2 The
demand for equality was no longer limited to political rights it was extended
also to the social conditions of individuals It was not simply class privileges
that were to be abolished but class distinctions themselves A Communism
ascetic denouncing all the pleasures of life Spartan was the first form
of the new teaching Then came the three great Utopians Saint Simon to
whom the middle class movement side by side with the proletarian still
had a certain significance Fourier and Owen who in the country where
capitalist production was most developed and under the influence of the
antagonisms begotten of this worked out his proposals for the removal
of class distinction systematically and in direct relation to French materialism 
One thing is common to all three Not one of them appears as a
representative of the interests of that proletariat which historical development
had in the meantime produced Like the French philosophers they do not
claim to emancipate a particular class to begin with but all humanity
at once Like them they wish to bring in the kingdom of reason and eternal
justice but this kingdom as they see it is as far as Heaven from Earth
from that of the French philosophers 
For to our three social reformers the bourgeois world based
upon the principles of these philosophers is quite as irrational and unjust
and therefore finds its way to the dust hole quite as readily as feudalism
and all the earlier stages of society If pure reason and justice have
not hitherto ruled the world this has been the case only because men
have not rightly understood them What was wanted was the individual man
of genius who has now arisen and who understands the truth That he has
now arisen that the truth has now been clearly understood is not an inevitable
event following of necessity in the chains of historical development
but a mere happy accident He might just as well have been born 500 years
earlier and might then have spared humanity 500 years of error strife
and suffering  
We saw how the French philosophers of the 18th century the forerunners of the Revolution appealed to reason as the sole judge of all that is A rational government rational society were to be founded everything that ran counter to eternal reason was to be remorselessly done away with We saw also that this eternal reason was in reality nothing but the idealized understanding of the 18th century citizen just then evolving into the bourgeois The French Revolution had realized this rational society and government    
But the new order of things rational enough as compared with earlier conditions turned out to be by no means absolutely rational The state based upon reason completely collapsed Rousseaus Contrat Social had found its realization in the Reign of Terror from which the bourgeoisie who had lost confidence in their own political capacity had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate and finally under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest The society based upon reason had fared no better The antagonism between rich and poor instead of dissolving into general prosperity had become intensified by the removal of the guild and other privileges which had to some extent bridged it over and by the removal of the charitable institutions of the Church The freedom of property from feudal fetters now veritably accomplished turned out to be for the small capitalists and small proprietors the freedom to sell their small property crushed under the overmastering competition of the large capitalists and landlords to these great lords and thus as far as the small capitalists and peasant proprietors were concerned became freedom from property The development of industry upon a capitalistic basis made poverty and misery of the working masses conditions of existence of society Cash payment became more and more in Carlyles phrase See Thomas Carlyle Past and Present London 1843 the sole nexus between man and man The number of crimes increased from year to year Formerly the feudal vices had openly stalked about in broad daylight though not eradicated they were now at any rate thrust into the background In their stead the bourgeois vices hitherto practiced in secret began to blossom all the more luxuriantly Trade became to a greater and greater extent cheating The fraternity of the revolutionary motto was realized in the chicanery and rivalries of the battle of competition Oppression by force was replaced by corruption the sword as the first social lever by gold The right of the first night was transferred from the feudal lords to the bourgeois manufacturers Prostitution increased to an extent never heard of Marriage itself remained as before the legally recognized form the official cloak of prostitution and moreover was supplemented by rich crops of adultery    
In a word compared with the splendid promises of the philosophers the social and political institutions born of the triumph of reason were bitterly disappointing caricatures All that was wanting was the men to formulate this disappointment and they came with the turn of the century In 1802 Saint Simons Geneva letters appeared in 1808 appeared Fouriers first work although the groundwork of his theory dated from 1799 on January 1 1800 Robert Owen undertook the direction of New Lanark    
At this time however the capitalist mode of production and with it the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat was still very incompletely developed Modern Industry which had just arisen in England was still unknown in France But Modern Industry develops on the one hand the conflicts which make absolutely necessary a revolution in the mode of production and the doing away with its capitalistic character  conflicts not only between the classes begotten of it but also between the very productive forces and the forms of exchange created by it And on the other hand it develops in these very gigantic productive forces the means of ending these conflicts If therefore about the year 1800 the conflicts arising from the new social order were only just beginning to take shape this holds still more fully as to the means of ending them The have nothing masses of Paris during the Reign of Terror were able for a moment to gain the mastery and thus to lead the bourgeois revolution to victory in spite of the bourgeoisie themselves But in doing so they only proved how impossible it was for their domination to last under the conditions then obtaining The proletariat which then for the first time evolved itself from these have nothing masses as the nucleus of a new class as yet quite incapable of independent political action appeared as an oppressed suffering order to whom in its incapacity to help itself help could at best be brought in from without or down from above    
This historical situation also dominated the founders of Socialism To the crude conditions of capitalistic production and the crude class conditions correspond crude theories The solution of the social problems which as yet lay hidden in undeveloped economic conditions the Utopians attempted to evolve out of the human brain Society presented nothing but wrongs to remove these was the task of reason It was necessary then to discover a new and more perfect system of social order and to impose this upon society from without by propaganda and wherever it was possible by the example of model experiments These new social systems were foredoomed as Utopian the more completely they were worked out in detail the more they could not avoid drifting off into pure phantasies    
These facts once established we need not dwell a moment longer upon this side of the question now wholly belonging to the past We can leave it to the literary small fry to solemnly quibble over these phantasies which today only make us smile and to crow over the superiority of their own bald reasoning as compared with such insanity For ourselves we delight in the stupendously grand thoughts and germs of thought that everywhere break out through their phantastic covering and to which these Philistines are blind    
 Saint Simon was a son of the great French Revolution at the outbreak of which he was not yet 30 The Revolution was the victory of the 3rd estate  ie of the great masses of the nation working in production and in trade over the privileged idle classes the nobles and the priests But the victory of the 3rd estate soon revealed itself as exclusively the victory of a smaller part of this estate as the conquest of political power by the socially privileged section of it  ie the propertied bourgeoisie And the bourgeoisie had certainly developed rapidly during the Revolution partly by speculation in the lands of the nobility and of the Church confiscated and afterwards put up for sale and partly by frauds upon the nation by means of army contracts It was the domination of these swindlers that under the Directorate brought France to the verge of ruin and thus gave Napoleon the pretext for his coup detat    
Hence to Saint Simon the antagonism between the 3rd Estate and the privileged classes took the form of an antagonism between workers and idlers The idlers were not merely the old privileged classes but also all who without taking any part in production or distribution lived on their incomes And the workers were not only the wage workers but also the manufacturers the merchants the bankers That the idlers had lost the capacity for intellectual leadership and political supremacy had been proved and was by the Revolution finally settled That the non possessing classes had not this capacity seemed to Saint Simon proved by the experiences of the Reign of Terror Then who was to lead and command According to Saint Simon science and industry both united by a new religious bond destined to restore that unity of religious ideas which had been lost since the time of the Reformation  a necessarily mystic and rigidly hierarchic new Christianity But science that was the scholars and industry that was in the first place the working bourgeois manufacturers merchants bankers These bourgeois were certainly intended by Saint Simon to transform themselves into a kind of public officials of social trustees but they were still to hold vis a vis of the workers a commanding and economically privileged position The bankers especially were to be called upon to direct the whole of social production by the regulation of credit This conception was in exact keeping with a time in which Modern Industry in France and with it the chasm between bourgeoisie and proletariat was only just coming into existence But what Saint Simon especially lays stress upon is this what interests him first and above all other things is the lot of the class that is the most numerous and the most poor  la classe la plus nombreuse et la plus pauvre    
Already in his Geneva letters Saint Simon lays down the proposition that all men ought to work In the same work he recognizes also that the Reign of Terror was the reign of the non possessing masses    
See says he to them what happened in France at the time when your comrades held sway there they brought about a famine Lettres dun habitant de Geneve a ses contemporains Saint Simon 1803
 But to recognize the French Revolution as a class war and not simply one between nobility and bourgeoisie but between nobility bourgeoisie and the non possessors was in the year 1802 a most pregnant discovery In 1816 he declares that politics is the science of production and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production  that is to say the abolition of the state about which recently there has been so much noise 
Saint Simon shows the same superiority over his contemporaries when in 1814 immediately after the entry of the allies into Paris and again in 1815 during the Hundred Days War he proclaims the alliance of France and England and then of both of these countries with Germany as the only guarantee for the prosperous development and peace of Europe To preach to the French in 1815 an alliance with the victors of Waterloo required as much courage as historical foresight 
 If in Saint Simon we find a comprehensive breadth of view by virtue of which almost all the ideas of later Socialists that are not strictly economic are found in him in embryo we find in Fourier a criticism of the existing conditions of society genuinely French and witty but not upon that account any the less thorough Fourier takes the bourgeoisie their inspired prophets before the Revolution and their interested eulogists after it at their own word He lays bare remorselessly the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world He confronts it with the earlier philosophers dazzling promises of a society in which reason alone should reign of a civilization in which happiness should be universal of an illimitable human perfectibility and with the rose colored phraseology of the bourgeois ideologists of his time He points out how everywhere the most pitiful reality corresponds with the most high sounding phrases and he overwhelms this hopeless fiasco of phrases with his mordant sarcasm 
Fourier is not only a critic his imperturbably serene nature makes him a satirist and assuredly one of the greatest satirists of all time He depicts with equal power and charm the swindling speculations that blossomed out upon the downfall of the Revolution and the shopkeeping spirit prevalent in and characteristic of French commerce at that time Still more masterly is his criticism of the bourgeois form of the relations between sexes and the position of woman in bourgeois society He was the first to declare that in any given society the degree of womans emancipation is the natural measure of the general emancipation 
But Fourier is at his greatest in his conception of the history of society He divides its whole course thus far into four stages of evolution  savagery barbarism the patriarchate civilization This last is identical with the so called civil or bourgeois society of today  ie with the social order that came in with the 16th century He proves that the civilized stage raises every vice practiced by barbarism in a simple fashion into a form of existence complex ambiguous equivocal hypocritical  that civilization moves in a vicious circle in contradictions which it constantly reproduces without being able to solve them hence it constantly arrives at the very opposite to that which it wants to attain or pretends to want to attain so that eg under civilization poverty is born of superabundance itself Theorie de lunite universelle Fourier 1843 and Le nouveau monde industriel et societaire ou invention du procede dindustrie attrayante et enaturelle distribuee en series passionnees Fourier 1845 
Fourier as we see uses the dialectic method in the same masterly way as his contemporary Hegel Using these same dialectics he argues against talk about illimitable human perfectibility that every historical phase has its period of ascent and also its period of descent and he applies this observation to the future of the whole human race As Kant introduced into natural science the idea of the ultimate destruction of the Earth Fourier introduced into historical science that of the ultimate destruction of the human race 
Whilst in France the hurricane of the Revolution swept over the land in England a quieter but not on that account less tremendous revolution was going on Steam and the new tool making machinery were transforming manufacture into modern industry and thus revolutionizing the whole foundation of bourgeois society The sluggish march of development of the manufacturing period changed into a veritable storm and stress period of production With constantly increasing swiftness the splitting up into large capitalists and non possessing proletarians went on Between these instead of the former stable middle class an unstable mass of artisans and small shopkeepers the most fluctuating portion of the population now led a precarious existence 
The new mode of production was as yet only at the beginning of its period of ascent as yet it was the normal regular method of production  the only one possible under existing conditions Nevertheless even then it was producing crying social abuses  the herding together of a homeless population in the worst quarters of the large towns the loosening of all traditional moral bonds of patriarchal subordination of family relations overwork especially of women and children to a frightful extent complete demoralization of the working class suddenly flung into altogether new conditions from the country into the town from agriculture into modern industry from stable conditions of existence into insecure ones that change from day to day 
 At this juncture there came forward as a reformer a manufacturer 29 years old  a man of almost sublime childlike simplicity of character and at the same time one of the few born leaders of men Robert Owen had adopted the teaching of the materialistic philosophers that mans character is the product on the one hand of heredity on the other of the environment of the individual during his lifetime and especially during his period of development In the industrial revolution most of his class saw only chaos and confusion and the opportunity of fishing in these troubled waters and making large fortunes quickly He saw in it the opportunity of putting into practice his favorite theory and so of bringing order out of chaos He had already tried it with success as superintendent of more than 500 men in a Manchester factory From 1800 to 1829 he directed the great cotton mill at New Lanark in Scotland as managing partner along the same lines but with greater freedom of action and with a success that made him a European reputation A population originally consisting of the most diverse and for the most part very demoralized elements a population that gradually grew to 2500 he turned into a model colony in which drunkenness police magistrates lawsuits poor laws charity were unknown And all this simply by placing the people in conditions worthy of human beings and especially by carefully bringing up the rising generation He was the founder of infant schools and introduced them first at New Lanark At the age of two the children came to school where they enjoyed themselves so much that they could scarely be got home again Whilst his competitors worked their people 13 or 14 hours a day in New Lanark the working day was only 10 and a half hours When a crisis in cotton stopped work for four months his workers received their full wages all the time And with all this the business more than doubled in value and to the last yielded large profits to its proprietors 
In spite of all this Owen was not content The existence which he secured for his workers was in his eyes still far from being worthy of human beings The people were slaves at my mercy The relatively favorable conditions in which he had placed them were still far from allowing a rational development of the character and of the intellect in all directions much less of the free exercise of all their faculties 
 And yet the working part of this population of 2500 persons was daily producing as much real wealth for society as less than half a century before it would have required the working part of a population of 600000 to create I asked myself what became of the difference between the wealth consumed by 2500 persons and that which would have been consumed by 600000 3 
The answer was clear It had been used to pay the proprietors of the establishment 5 per cent on the capital they had laid out in addition to over £300000 clear profit And that which held for New Lanark held to a still greater extent for all the factories in England 
If this new wealth had not been created by machinery imperfectly as it has been applied the wars of Europe in opposition to Napoleon and to support the aristocratic principles of society could not have been maintained And yet this new power was the creation of the working classes 
 Note l c p22 
To them therefore the fruits of this new power belonged The newly created gigantic productive forces hitherto used only to enrich individuals and to enslave the masses offered to Owen the foundations for a reconstruction of society they were destined as the common property of all to be worked for the common good of all 
Owens communism was based upon this purely business foundation the outcome so to say of commercial calculation Throughout it maintained this practical character Thus in 1823 Owen proposed the relief of the distress in Ireland by Communist colonies and drew up complete estimates of costs of founding them yearly expenditure and probable revenue And in his definite plan for the future the technical working out of details is managed with such practical knowledge  ground plan front and side and birds eye views all included  that the Owen method of social reform once accepted there is from the practical point of view little to be said against the actual arrangement of details 
His advance in the direction of Communism was the turning point in Owens life As long as he was simply a philanthropist he was rewarded with nothing but wealth applause honor and glory He was the most popular man in Europe Not only men of his own class but statesmen and princes listened to him approvingly But when he came out with his Communist theories that was quite another thing Three great obstacles seemed to him especially to block the path to social reform private property religion the present form of marriage 
He knew what confronted him if he attacked these  outlawry excommunication from official society the loss of his whole social position But nothing of this prevented him from attacking them without fear of consequences and what he had foreseen happened Banished from official society with a conspiracy of silence against him in the press ruined by his unsuccessful Communist experiments in America in which he sacrificed all his fortune he turned directly to the working class and continued working in their midst for 30 years Every social movement every real advance in England on behalf of the workers links itself on to the name of Robert Owen He forced through in 1819 after five years fighting the first law limiting the hours of labor of women and children in factories He was president of the first Congress at which all the Trade Unions of England united in a single great trade association He introduced as transition measures to the complete communistic organization of society on the one hand cooperative societies for retail trade and production These have since that time at least given practical proof that the merchant and the manufacturer are socially quite unnecessary On the other hand he introduced labor bazaars for the exchange of the products of labor through the medium of labor notes whose unit was a single hour of work institutions necessarily doomed to failure but completely anticipating Proudhons bank of exchange of a much later period and differing entirely from this in that it did not claim to be the panacea for all social ills but only a first step towards a much more radical revolution of society 
The Utopians mode of thought has for a long time governed the Socialist ideas of the 19th century and still governs some of them Until very recently all French and English Socialists did homage to it The earlier German Communism including that of Weitling was of the same school To all these Socialism is the expression of absolute truth reason and justice and has only to be discovered to conquer all the world by virtue of its own power And as an absolute truth is independent of time space and of the historical development of man it is a mere accident when and where it is discovered With all this absolute truth reason and justice are different with the founder of each different school And as each ones special kind of absolute truth reason and justice is again conditioned by his subjective understanding his conditions of existence the measure of his knowledge and his intellectual training there is no other ending possible in this conflict of absolute truths than that they shall be mutually exclusive of one another Hence from this nothing could come but a kind of eclectic average Socialism which as a matter of fact has up to the present time dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in France and England Hence a mish mash allowing of the most manifold shades of opinion a mish mash of such critical statements economic theories pictures of future society by the founders of different sects as excite a minimum of opposition a mish mash which is the more easily brewed the more definite sharp edges of the individual constituents are rubbed down in the stream of debate like rounded pebbles in a brook 
To make a science of Socialism it had first to be placed upon a real basis

This is the passage on the French Revolution

Thought the concept of law all at once made itself felt and against this the old scaffolding of wrong could make no stand  In this conception of law therefore a constitution has now been established and henceforth everything must be based upon this  Since the Sun had been in the firmament and the planets circled around him the sight had never been seen of man standing upon his head  ie on the Idea  and building reality after this image  Anaxagoras first said that the Nous Reason rules the world but now for the first time had men come to recognize that the Idea must rule the mental reality  And this was a magnificent sunrise  All thinking Beings have participated in celebrating this holy day  A sublime emotion swayed men at that time an enthusiasm of reason pervaded the world as if now had come the reconciliation of the Divine Principle with the world

      It is now necessary for us to turn for a while from the
      political progress of Socialism to note the school of thinkers who preceded the
      birth of modern scientific or revolutionary Socialism These men thought it
      possible to regenerate Society by laying before it its short comings follies and
      injustice and by teaching through precept and example certain schemes of
      reconstruction built up from the aspirations and insight of the teachers
      themselves They had not learned to recognize the sequence of events which forces
      social changes on mankind whether they are conscious of its force or not but
      believed that their schemes would win their way to general adoption by mens
      perception of their inherent reasonableness They hoped to convert people to
      Socialism to accepting it consciously and formally by showing them the contrast
      between the confusion and misery of existing civilization and the order and
      happiness of the world which they foresaw
    

      From the elaborate and detailed schemes of future Society which they built up they
      have been called the Utopists the representatives of the different phases of their
      school are three most remarkable men born within a few years of each other whose
      aspirations and insight have done a very great deal to further the progress of
      Socialism in spite of the incompleteness of their views
    

      Robert Owen was born at Newtown Montgomeryshire in 1771 of a lower middle class
      family he became a successful manufacturer through his own industry and
      quick wittedness in the beginning of the rise of the Great Machine Industries when
      manufacturing was advancing by leaps and bounds He was a born philanthropist
      in the better sense of the word and from the first showed in all matters unbounded
      generosity and magnanimity In the year 1800 when he was not yet thirty he became
      the manager of the New Lanark Mills and set to work on his first great experiment
      which was briefly the conversion of a miserable stupid and vicious set of people
      into a happy industrious and orderly community acting on the theory that man is
      the creature of his surroundings and that by diligent attention to the development
      of his nature he can be brought to perfection In
      this experiment he was entirely successful but it was not in him to stop there as
      the plain words he said of his success showed clearly enough Yet these men were
      my slaves 1 He took part in all kinds of
      projects of a philanthropical nature still founding all his action on his theory
      of the perfectibility of man by the amelioration of his surroundings and became
      the first great champion of co operation although he did not suppose as the
      co operators of the present day do that anything short of universal co operation
      would solve the social question In 1815 he pressed a meeting of Glasgow
      manufacturers to petition Parliament to shorten the hours of labour in the cotton
      mills and the change which he experienced from the approbation of the governing
      classes to their reprobation may well date from that proceeding of his as a
      bourgeois biographer of his hints But he still kept his position of a popular
      philanthropist even after his declaration in favour of cc operation until he at
      last cut himself off from respectability by openly attacking Society through its
      received religions  August 21 1816 from which date onward he was scouted by all
      that Society of which he was now the declared enemy But he was in nowise
      daunted In 1823 he proposed Communistic villages as a remedy fo the distress in
      Ireland he established in 1832 an exchange in Grays Inn Road in which labour
      was equitably exchanged against labour and in 1825 he bought New Harmony from a
      community already established there  the Rappites and made his great experiment
      in living in common and late in life he published his Book of the New Moral
      World which contains the exposition of his doctrine
    

      It will be thus seen that he was unwearied in practical experiments His
      shortcoming was the necessary one of the utopist a total disregard of the
      political side of progress he failed to see that his experiments useful as they
      were from that point of view could never develope  sic out of the
      experimental state as long as the governors of Society forcibly uphold the
      so called rights of property and he ignored the antagonism of classes
      necessarily existing under this system and which in the long run must bring about
      the Socialism which he the most generous and best of men spent his whole life in
      attempting to realize He died in 1858
    

      Saint Simon was born of a noble family at Paris in 1760 He acquired and ran
      through a fortune deliberately experimenting in the various forms of life from
      extravagance to abject poverty There was in him none of that tendency to practical
      experiment in quasi Socialistic schemes which characterized Robert Owen His
      philosophy was mingled with a mysticism which had a tendency to increase a
      tendency to form a new religion rather than to realize a new condition of life and
      which was carried into the absurdities of a kind of worship by his immediate
      followers more or less imitated by the Positivists of our own day whose founder
      Auguste Comte was his most cherished disciple His Socialism was of a vague kind
      and admitted the existence of classes of talent as expressed by the motto of Saint
      Simonism From each according to his capacity to each according to his deeds In
      spite however of the tendency to mysticism he showed singular flashes of insight
      in matters historical and economic and intellectually was certainly ahead of
      Robert Owen He may be said to have set himself the task of learning all life by
      whatever means and at whatever expense in order to devote himself to the new
      religion whose great aim is the swiftest possible amelioration of the moral and
      physical condition of the poorest and most numerous class
    

      Frederick Engels well says of him As early as his Letters from Geneva Saint
      Simon laid down that all men ought to work and that the Reign of Terror had been
      the reign of the non possessing masses To face the fact in 1802 that the French
      Revolution was a struggle between the noblesse the bourgeoisie and the
      non possessing classes was a discovery of genius In 1816 he asserted that politics
      were but the science of production and predicted their absorption by economy The
      knowledge that economic conditions serve as the base of political institutions only
      shows itself here in the germ nevertheless this proposition contains clearly the
      conversion of the political government of men into an administration of things and
      a direction of the process of production that is to say the abolition of the
      State of which such a noise has since been made
    

      Internationalism also was clearly enunciated by Saint Simon We quote Engels again
      With an equal superiority over the views of his contemporaries he declared in
      1814 immediately after the entry of the allies into Paris and again in 1815
      during the war of the hundred days that the sole guarantee of the peace and
      prosperous development of Europe was an alliance between France and England and
      of those two countries with Germany Certainly it needed a courage by no means
      common to preach to the French of 1815 alliance with the victors at Waterloo
    

      It is worth noting that one of the schemes of the Saint Simonians which was most
      ridiculed at the time was the cutting of the Isthmuses of Suez and Panama and
      that M de Lesseps was a Saint Simonian
    

      Saint Simon died in great poverty in 1825 with words of hope for the future of the
      party on his lips
    

      Charles Fourier was born in 1772 at Lyons his father was a draper He lost his
      property in the Revolution and afterwards went into business as a broker Amidst
      his dealings with Society he was early struck by the shortcomings and injustices
      of individualism and competition In his first book The Theory of the Four
      Movements he elaborates the proposition that human nature is perfectible through
      the free play of the appetites and passions and asserts that misery and vice
      spring from the restraints imposed by Society His
      criticism of modern Society is most valuable as anticipating that of scientific
      Socialism unlike his contemporaries he has an insight into the historical growth
      of Society He divides it into four periods of development Savagery Barbarism
      Patriarchalism and Civilization meaning by the latter the Bourgeois
      Civilization 2 His saying In civilization
      poverty is born even of superabundance may well be noted in these days and
      compared with Robert Owens in 1816 Our best customer the war is dead
    

      As a basis of the reconstruction of Society Fourier advocated Industrial
      Co operation but here his Utopianism led him to the trap of formulating
      dogmatically an electorate scheme of life in all its details a scheme which could
      never be carried out however good the principlse  sic on which it was
      based might be His scheme arranges for phalanxsteries as the unit of co operation
      in which all life and all industry agricultural and other should be carried on
      and all details are carried out by him most minutely the number of each
      phalanxtery being settled at 1600 souls His most valuable idea was the possibility
      and necessity of apportioning due labour to each capacity and thereby assuring
      that it should be always pleasurable and his dictum that children who generally
      like making dirt  pies and getting into a mess should do the dirty work of the
      community may at least be looked on as an illustration of this idea though laid
      down as a formal law His system was not one of pure equality but admitted
      distinctions between rich and  comparatively poor and advocated a fantastic
      division of wealth between labour capital and talent The abolition of marriage
      was a tenet of his doctrine
    

      In 1812 Fouriers mother died and left him some property and he retired into the
      country to write his Treatise on the Association of Domesticity and Agriculture
      Afterwards he came to Paris again became a clerk in an American firm and wrote in
      1830 his New Industrial World It is lamentable to have to relate that in 1831 he
      wrote attacking both Owen and St Simon as charlatans in spite of the curious
      points of resemblance he had to either of them He died in 1837 but not till he
      had founded a school of which Victor Considerans author of the Destinee
      Sociale was the most distinguished member The Fourierists started a paper in
      1832 which expired in two years but was revived in 1836 and finally suppressed
      by Government in 1850 A scheme for realizing the Phalanxtery experimentally was
      set on foot in 1832 by a deputy of France but it failed for lack of funds so that
      of the three great Utopists Owen was the only one who had the fortune good or bad
      as it may be considered of seeing his schemes tried by experience Cabet indeed
      a revolutionist of 48 founded a community in America under the name of Icaria
      which was  and is for it still exists more nearly an approach to genuine
      Communism than any of the other communities which have owed their origin to Utopian
      Socialism Of these communities there remains a word to be said as a warning to
      those who are young in Socialism Although as experiments in association something
      may be learned from them their conditions of life have no claim to the title of
      Communism which most unluckily has often been applied to them Communism can never
      be realized till the present system of Society has been destroyed by the workers
      taking hold of the political power When that happens it will mean that Communism
      is on the point of absorbing and transmuting Civilization
    

1Yet in 1806 when owing to the rise in cotton he
      could not continue manufacturing he stopped the mills and paid his people their
      full wages till he could go on again in fou months time a prodeeding which cost
      him £7000back

I 207
We now touch on civilisations most sensitive spot it is an unpleasant task to raise ones voice against the folly of the day against chimeras that are downright epidemical
To speak against the absurdities of trade today means to expose oneself to anathemas just as much as if one had spoken against the tyranny of the popes and the barons in the twelfth century If it were a matter of choosing between two dangerous roles I think it would be less dangerous to offend a sovereign with bitter truths than to offend the mercantile spirit which now rules as a despot over civilisation and even over sovereigns
And yet a superficial analysis will prove that our commercial systems debase and disorganise civilisation and that in trade as in all other things we are going astray more and more under the guidance of the inexact sciences
The controversy on trade is hardly half a century old and has already produced thousands of volumes and yet its originators have not seen that the trade mechanism is organised in such a way that it is a slap in the face for all common sense It has subordinated the whole of society to one class of parasitical and unproductive people the merchants All the essential classes of society  the proprietor It must not be forgotten that Fourier was not a Communist  Note by Engels the farmer the manufacturer and even the government  find themselves dominated by an inessential accessory class the merchant who should be their subordinate their employed agent removable and accountable and who nevertheless directs and obstructs at will all the mainsprings of circulation
In respect of errors other than those of trade public opinion and the learned bodies are indeed more tractable it is pretty well agreed that the philosophical systems are dangerous illusions that experience belies our boasting of perfection that our theories of freedom do not square with civilisation that our virtues are social comedies and our legislations labyrinths there are even jokes about a fashionable controversy ideology 208 But tongue wagging about commerce with its theories of imports and exports counterbalance balance and guarantee has become the Ark of the Covenant before which everything bows down This then is the illusion which we have to dispel
First of all we must show that our trade systems which are now gaped at with stupid veneration are the antipodes of truth of justice and therefore also of unity
It is difficult to make clear to a century that precisely that operation which it considers to he the masterpiece of all wisdom is nothing but the seal of ignorance stamped on its entire policy Let us but look at the already known results maritime monopoly fiscal monopoly growing national debts bankruptcies in unbroken succession resulting from paper money increasing villainy in all business relations Already now we can stigmatise the mechanism of free trade ie of free lying that veritable industrial anarchy that monstrous power in society
How is it that the most lying class in the social body is most protected by the apostles of truth How does it happen that today learned men who preach contempt of vile wealth praise only the class which pursues wealth per fas et nefas by legal or illegal means the class of stock exchange gamblers and corner men Formerly the philosophers were unanimous in censuring certain corporations which defended with flexibility of conscience the proposition that there is a difference between taking and Stealing How then have the same philosophers now become the apologists of a class which affirms with still greater immorality that haggling is not lying that to dupe the buyer is not the same as robbing him that stockjobbing and cornering are by no means plundering the productive class  in brief that one must work only for money not for fame  for that is the refrain which the merchants sing in chorus We dont pursue business pour la gloire This expression exists in literally the same form also among German merchants  Note by Engels Is it then to be wondered at that the modern sciences went astray when they espoused the cause of those who openly profess such principles
Trade takes various forms according to the various social stages for as it is the pivot of all social life it exists as soon as there is any social condition in general A people becomes social forms a society from the moment when it begins to carry out exchange For this reason trade exists already among the savages where it takes the form of direct barter Under patriarchy it becomes indirect commerce in barbarism the basis of the commercial method is formed by the monopolies the fixing of maximums and prices and forcible government requisitions and in civilisation by individual competition or lying and bewildering struggles
There is no need for us to dwell on direct barter among the sa ages who have no knowledge of money One man is lucky at the hunt and exchanges a piece of game for arrows made by another who has not been hunting and needs eatables This method is not even trade it is barter
The second method indirect commerce is primitive trade It is carried on through a go between who becomes the owner of something which he did not produce and he does not intend to consume This method although it is bad and leaves room for arbitrariness is nevertheless highly advantageous in the following three cases
1 in young countries where only agriculture exists without industry this is the state in which all colonies find themselves at the beginning
2 in harsh lands as in Siberia and the African deserts a merchant who defies heat and cold to carry objects of necessity to distant parts is a very useful man
3 in oppressed and constricted lands where the Bedouin plunder caravans exact ransom from merchants and often murder them  every kind of protection is due to him who braves these dangers in order to bring supplies to a distant land When such a merchant becomes rich he certainly deserves it
In these three cases the merchants are neither Stock Exchange gamblers nor corner men they do not hawk one speculator to another the objects intended for consumption On their arrival they offer them openly to the consumer in a bazaar or public market they are the accelerators of industrial movement They want to earn  nothing is more reasonable in the civilised world he who has sown deserves to harvest But it is very rare that the merchants content themselves with this function of theirs singly or in alliance they scheme to obstruct the circulation of commodities in order to make prices immediately soar
Trade becomes pernicious from the moment the go betweens due to their excessive number become parasites on the social body and are ready to conceal goods to let them rise in price under the pretext of an artificially produced scarcity in brief to rob simultaneously the producer and the consumer through speculation tricks instead of serving both as simple open go betweens We still see this openness at our small markets in villages and towns The man who buys a hundred calves or sheep is a useful intermediary for twenty peasants who would otherwise lose whole working days to bring them to market in town When on arriving at the market he publicly offers his animals for sale he thereby renders a service also to the consumers but when by means of heaven knows what tricks he agrees with other friends of trade to hide three quarters of the sheep to tell the butchers that sheep are scarce that he can only supply a few friends to sell them half as dear again under this pretext to alarm the buyers and then to bring the hidden sheep out one after the other to sell them at inflated prices in the atmosphere of alarm previously created and thus to extort a high ransom from the consumers  then this is no longer simple commerce open offering of commodities free from any intrigue it is compound commerce whose endlessly changing tricks give birth to the thirty six typical vices of our trade system and are tantamount to a legal monopoly When one lays hands on the total product by ruse in order to make it dearer that is robbing more by means of intrigues than the monopoly does by armed force
I shall not dwell any longer on the method of the barbarians It comprises fixing of maximums forcible requisitions and monopolies which are still quite customary also in the civilised state As I have already said elsewhere Charles Fourier Theorie de lunite universelle t 2 Prolegomene the various methods of individual periods overlap one must not wonder therefore that civilisation borrows individual features from both higher and lower stages Our civilised trade mechanism is thus an amalgamation of the characters of all periods with those of the civilised stage however predominating  and these are much more despicable still than those of barbarism because our trade is nothing but organised and legitimised robbery under the mask of legality As a result the racketeers and intermediaries can unite to cause artificial dearth of any foodstuffs and thus plunder both producers and consumers to heap up in a hurry scandalous fortunes of fifty millions whose owners nevertheless complain that there is no protection of trade that the merchants cannot subsist that nothing is done and that the state is being ruined if the merchant is reduced to the inability to make more than fifty millions
Meanwhile we are taught by a new science that these people should be granted complete freedom Let the merchants do their job we are told without this freedom the corner man who even so has earned only fifty million would perhaps not even have made a single million and his respectable family would have to manage on fifty thousand francs revenue  
Dii talem avertite casum
Ye gods ward off such an occurrence 
paraphrase from Virgils poem Aeneid Book III
 Contempt of commerce a contempt inborn in all peoples was prevalent in all nations considered to be honourable except for a few coastal clans of hucksters who derived benefit from commercial extortions and villainies Athens Tyre and Carthage which profited by commerce could not mock at it everybody refrains from mocking at the ways in which he has enriched himself and the financier least of all will mock at the art of adding ciphers to bills or allowing the enemy to take away the ledgers and putting the cash in safety while reporting it also as having been taken by the enemy
In reality with ancient as well as with modern peoples commerce has always been an object of mockery on the part of all honourable classes How can one have any esteem for an out and out rascally profession or a class of people who lie with every word they say and by means of this magic art cam millions while the honest landowner who cultivates his piece of land with great effort and exertion using the best of his experience barely achieves an insignificant increase in its yield
Meanwhile for a century a new science called Economics has been exalting hucksters stockjobbers corner men usurers bankrupts monopolisers and commercial parasites to the peak of honours the governments daily deeper and deeper in debt always intent on finding means of borrowing money have found themselves forced to conceal their contempt and to spare this class of mercantile blood suckers which keeps the money coffers locked to civilisation and pumps out all the treasures of agricultural and industrial diligence under the pretext of serving it It is not denied that trade ensures transportation victualling and distribution but it does so like a servant who performs service actually worth a thousand francs annually and on the other hand robs his master of ten thousand francs or ten times as much as he produces
As a young spendthrift secretly despises the Jew to whom he goes every week to get himself fleeced but still always greets him very politely so also the modern governments have with obvious contempt concluded an armistice with trade which is doing all the better for the fact that it knows how to have itself lumped together with the very manufacturers whom it plunders The economists who have found in this merchants hotchpotch a nursery of new dogmas a mine of systems have overthrown morality with all its high sounding talk of truth in order to enthrone their favourites the stockjobbers and bankrupts Thereupon all the scholars rivalled in self abasement in the beginning science admitted those friends of trade as its equals  Voltaire dedicated a tragedy to an English merchant Voltaire Zaire Today these stockjobbers would have a good laugh if a scholar presumed to dedicate a tragedy to them Stockjobbing has discarded the mask it no longer needs the incense of the scholars it wants secret  and soon legal  participation in government And indeed we have seen the Aachen Congress unable to decide anything until two bankers arrived 209
Despite the fact that the economic systems have exalted the Golden Calf of trade they have been unable to put an end to the natural contempt which the nations feel towards it It remains despised by the nobility the clergy the propertied classes the officials the lawyers the scholars despised by artists soldiers and every class worthy of respect In vain has trade heaped sophism on sophism to prove to them that the stockjobbing blood sucker should he respected  a natural disdain for this class of upstarts still prevails Everybody yields to the upswing of a dogma favoured by fortune but everybody continues in secret to despise the mercantile hydra which takes no notice of this and pursues the course of its conquests
How is it that our century has made public the crimes of so many classes even those of the Federates 210 who only existed for a month in 1815 whence comes it that it has never occurred to this century which has spared neither kings nor popes in its collections on crimes to make public the crimes of the merchants Yet writers are unanimous in complaining that they suffer from a lack of material To show them how fruitful this material is I shall make a methodical analysis of only a single one of the  thirty six crimes of civilised trade These thirty six reprehensible features of our trade under the domination of individual competition and of bewildering and lying struggle are the following

II
Falseness of the Economic Principles on Circulation

 Proved by three features of the Table Nos 7 8 and 12 artificial obstruction of supply sources oppressive surpluses and fictitious money

Our century which has been so prolific of theories about the movement of industry still cannot distinguish circulation from obstruction It confuses circulation interrupted in places with that which is uninterrupted simple circulation with compound However let us leave these dull distinctions the facts may speak and serve us as a basis for principles which are directly opposed to those of economics

Both governments and peoples agree that forgers both of money and of public securities should he punished with death Those who counterfeit coins and bank notes are indeed condemned to death A very wise precautionary measure But why does trade enjoy the right to forge money when this practice brings other people to the gallows

Every bill of exchange made out by a merchant bears the seed of counterfeit for it is extremely uncertain whether it will ever be paid Everyone who steers a course towards bankruptcy floods circulation with his bills of exchange without intending ever to pay them In this way he in fact makes and spreads counterfeit money

Will it be objected that everyone else enjoys the same privilege that a property owner like a merchant can put bills of exchange into circulation

That is not true A property owner cannot do that A right is illusory when it cannot be exercised Witness the constitutional right of the people to sovereignty a pompous prerogative in spite of which the plebeian cannot even get his midday meal if he has not a sou in his pocket And yet how far from the pretension to sovereignty is the claim to a midday meal Many rights exist thus on paper but not in reality and their granting is an insult to him who cannot even ensure himself rights a hundred times less important

So it is with the property owner as regards the issuing of bills of exchange He has the right to issue them as the plebeian has the right to claim sovereignty but to possess the right and to exercise it are two very different things When the property owner makes out a bill of exchange he win not find anybody who will accept it without a guarantee and he will be treated as one who forges money He will be required to hypothecate a completely debt free immovable property and to pay a usurious rate of interest into the bargain His bills of exchange would be accepted at this price and with such a security they would be money with real value not fictitious money like those of a second hand dealer who by virtue of his title as a friend of trade finds means of putting into circulation good bills to the value of a million when he does not possess even the hundredth part of that sum even 10000 francs as guarantee for that million

How beautifully those governments let themselves be cheated who deprive themselves of this ability and guarantee it for the merchant A merchant who has ten thousand francs security issues bills of exchange to the amount of a minion when he pleases he is protected and authorised to do so he has the right to set this mass of paper in circulation without the law being entitled to investigate how he places his capital and what securities he has The Treasury offering a guarantee of say ten million would have to he able according to this ratio to issue securities up to a thousand million But if a government tries to do so without consulting public opinion without informing it of the move it will see its credit ruined and its country exposed to political disturbances and yet it is only doing the same only availing itself of the same privilege which is enjoyed by so many schemers who often cannot offer the hundredth part of these guarantees and cannot run their business

It will be answered that these schemers know how to talk over the foolish and insinuate themselves into their confidence it is therefore set up as a principle of commerce that the art of duping and plundering good natured credulous people deserves to be protected in every way and that this protection must be limited to the merchant and not be enjoyed by the government I do not maintain that this fine art should he allowed to both but on the contrary that it should he denied both to rulers and to merchants

From this it follows that the merchant enjoys the ability to issue fictitious money in the form of bills of exchange  twelfth feature  a crime which is equivalent to forging money for which the other categories of rascals are sent to the gallows  and that the trade system of civilised people legalises and protects competition of fraudulence  third feature

The accusation of forging money like the other points of the accusation will be answered as follows there must he merchants in order to ensure circulation and business would become impossible if these agents were placed under restraint the state would disrupt the public credit and place the whole of its industry in jeopardy

It is true enough that a quality of trade is that it forges our fetters still tighter whenever the social body shows any signs of resistance As soon as any administrative measure hampers the machinations of trade trade restricts credit and paralyses circulation while the state which wanted to eliminate an old disorder in the end adds new ones This effect is called repercussion  eleventh feature in the Table

This danger is used as the basis for establishing the principle Let the merchants do their job their complete freedom is the guarantee of circulation An exceedingly false principle for it is precisely this complete freedom which gives rise to all the tricks that are so obstructive to circulation stockjobbing cornering bankruptcy and so on the consequences of which are the two features
7 Artificial obstruction of supply sources
8 Oppressive surpluses

Let us see what influence these two features have on circulation

Trade does not content itself with delivering commodities from the producer to the consumer it schemes by means of cornering and stockjobbing speculation to produce an artificial dearth of those food articles which are not exactly plentiful In 1807 a stockjobbing manoeuvre suddenly raised the price of sugar to five francs in the month of May and the same sugar dropped to two francs in July although not the slightest new supplies had arrived But the stockjobbing had been countered by means of false information and thus the sugar had been brought down to its value the scheming and artificially aroused fears that there would he no supply had been disposed of These schemes and artificial fears play their tricks every day with some food article and make it scarce without a real scarcity existing In 1812 when the harvest was assured and the corner men were disappointed in their hopes enormous quantities of grain and flour were suddenly seen coming from their warehouses So there had been no shortage at all and absolutely no danger of famine if only these foodstuffs had been distributed rationally But trade has the peculiarity that even before there is a danger with an eye to its possibility it diverts supplies stops circulation arouses panicky fears produces artificial food shortage

The same effect is produced in times of surplus when trade obstructs supplies out of affected fear of profusion In the former case it operates positively by buying up foodstuffs in anticipation in the latter case negatively by not buying and thus causing prices to drop so low that the peasant does not even get his production costs refunded Hence arises the eighth feature oppressive surpluses

Trade will retort that it does not need to buy when it foresees no profit and that it will not he so insane as to overload itself with grain which offers no probability at all of a surcharge while it trade can invest its capital far more usefully in such commodities as hold out profit for it because of their scarcity which can easily he increased by cornering

There you have convenient and pleasant principles in a social system in which people talk about nothing but mutual guarantees Trade is therefore exempted whenever it pleases from serving the social body It acts like an army which would be authorised to refuse to fight whenever danger were present and to do service only in its own interest without any consideration for the state interest Such is our mercantile policy so one sidedly does it determine all obligations

In 1820 the price of grain dropped below three francs in various provinces in which a price of four francs hardly covered the costs This would not have occurred had French trade bought in advance six months food supplies for thirty million persons as it would have had to do under a system of mutuality adapting itself to the interests of both parties a This reserve stock withdrawn from circulation and locked up in granaries would have kept up the price of the rest and the peasant would not have suffered from the depreciation and the impossibility to market his products But our trade system works exactly in the Opposite direction it aggravates the pressure b of surplus and the evils of famine and thus has a destructive effect on both side

I have chosen the eighth feature oppressive surplus to show that the existing mode of trade has both negative and positive defects and that it often sins by non intervention by omitting a service which it could easily render For when in a time of famine the sum of five hundred million is required to buy up the corn it is immediately available but if this sum is needed for precautionary measures to increase stocks in times of surplus not even five hundred talers c can he scraped together There is neither mutuality nor guarantee in the contract concluded between the social body and the commercial body The latter serves only its own interest not that of society and hence the abundant capital which it uses is a robbery perpetrated against industry as a whole In the Table I have listed this robbery as the fifth feature Removal of capital

Thus on both sides of trade there is not the slightest sense of obligation towards the social body which surrenders itself bound hand and foot to the Minotaur to whom it guarantees despotic power over capitals and foodstuffs Yes indeed despotic power After so many declamations against despotism we still have not discovered the real one which is no other than the despotism of trade that real satrap of the civilised world

To sum up it follows from this that the civilised mechanism guarantees the merchants complete impunity for the crime of forging money for which other classes are punished with death  and that this impunity is based on the pretence of help which they allegedly render to circulation but in reality refuse  positively by artificial obstruction of supply sources and negatively by oppressive profusion

To this falsity in the results must be added the lack of any principles The economists admit that their science has absolutely no fixed principles and it is indeed the height of unprincipledness to grant complete freedom to a class of so exceedingly depraved agents as the merchants

The consequence of all this is that the commercial movement proceeds by fits and starts in spasms surprises and excesses of all descriptions as can be seen every day in the present trade mechanism which can achieve only a periodically interrupted circulation without regular graduation without balance and guarantees

An amusing result of this disorder is that people have the courage to reproach the government with financial abuses which they never dare to reproach trade with Witness the two bankruptcies  that of Laws bank notes and that of the assignats 211 These were gradual bankruptcies they were seen approaching from afar with a timely partial sacrifice they could have been guarded against Despite these extenuating circumstances the public gave no quarter It rightly declared Laws notes and the assignats to be forgery armed plunder

Why then does the same public good naturedly tolerate the issue of counterfeit money by the merchants when it does not allow it for governments even when these are cautious enough to prepare for the bankruptcy by a slow depreciation which affords the holders of the papers the possibility to evade it This possibility does not exist for the holders of the securities issued by trade Bankruptcy strikes them like a thunderclap Many a man goes to sleep tonight in possession of 300000 francs and wakes up tomorrow with no more than 100000 as a result of a bankruptcy The National Convention copied this manoeuvre in the operation of the Consolidated Third 212 people did not tire of reproaching it with this as a fully established robbery And yet every merchant is allowed the right to commit still more vexatious robberies and to steal by bankruptcy two thirds of what he received whereas the Convention withheld two thirds of sums it had never received How outrageous the crimes of trade become when compared with other and even the biggest political infamies

The following details will demonstrate that modern politics by handing over trade to completely free merchants exempt from any kind of obligation has set the wolf among the fold and provoked robberies of all kinds

Let us now go on to bankruptcy to describe it in somewhat greater detail

When a crime becomes very frequent one gets accustomed to it and witnesses it with indifference 213 In Italy or Spain people remain quite cool at the sight of a hired assassin stabbing his designated victim and taking refuge in a church where he enjoys immunity In Italy one sees fathers mutilate and murder their children to improve their voice while the servants of the God of peace encourage them to perpetrate these brutalities so as to obtain good singers for their choirs Such abominations would arouse the indignation of all other civilised nations if they occurred amongst them but on the other hand they have other outrageous customs which would make the Italians blood boil
If the customs and opinions within civilisation differ so much from nation to nation how much more must they differ from one social epoch to another how hateful would the vices which are tolerated in civilisation seem in less imperfect social stagesOne can hardly believe that countries which call themselves well ordered can tolerate for a moment such abominations as bankruptcy  
Bankruptcy is the most ingenious and shameless villainy that has ever existed it guarantees every merchant the ability to rob the public of a sum proportionate to his fortune or his credit so that a rich man can say I set up as a tradesman in 1808 on such and such a day in the year 1810 I will steal so and so many minions whoever they may belong to
Let us leave aside a present development the new French code 214 and its intention to punish bankruptcy There is no unanimity in respect of the success of this intention and means of evading the new laws are already being suggested Therefore we shall first let practice decide and meanwhile base our arguments on already known facts consider the disorders which result from the philosophical system and the principle Leave the merchants complete freedom without demanding any guarantee of the cleverness the honesty or the solvency of each individual
From these arises alongside other abuses bankruptcy a still more heinous robbery than highway robbery However people have become accustomed to it and put up with it so well that they even recognise honest bankruptcies  those in which the speculator steals only half
Let us go on to a detailed description of this kind of heroism which was little known in antiquity Since then it has experienced a brilliant upswing It presents analysts with a series of developments which testify to our progress towards perfectibility

Ascending Wing of Bankrupts
In a very depraved very grasping century one would be a general laughing stock if one declaimed in a schoolmasters tone against the accredited vices against bankruptcy It is much more sensible to chime in the dominant tone and to see the funny side of social crimes So I shall try to prove that bankruptcy is an even much more laughable villainy than it is believed to be by its promoters and protectors who see nothing but well behaved trifles in its mercantile plunder
Everything is relative in vice as in virtue Even robbers have their standards of justice and honour It is therefore no wonder that among themselves bankrupts admit principles and degrees in rascality I have sought to use these as a basis for my division I have divided them according to the custom in three corps the first of which contains the light graceful hues the second the imposing lofty characters and the third the rather inconspicuous trivial genera The right wing will open the rnarch past

The Innocent
1 Child bankruptcy is that of the greenhorn who is making his debut in the career and inconsiderately without any preparatory tactics indulges in the mad prank of going bankrupt The notary easily puts the affair in order He presents it as a folly of youth and says Youth counts on your indulgence Messieurs the Creditors The annoying business is wound up to the merriment of the public for these greenhorn bankruptcies are always interlarded with amusing incidents duped usurers mystified skinflints etc
The bankrupt of this genus can risk masses of shabby affairs appropriation of goods scandalous loans thefts from relatives friends neighbours  everything is washed away by the argument of a relative who says to the irate creditors What can you expect  he is a child without any knowledge of business one must close ones eyes where young people are concerned he will improve with time
These child bankrupts have a strong support on their side namely mockery One likes to mock in trade one is inclined to mock at those who are duped rather than to censure the villains and when a bankrupt has the laughers on his side he is sure to see the majority of his creditors capitulate immediately and to win his composition by assault
2 Daredevil bankruptcy that of certain beginners who play double or quits people who gallop off at full speed speculate and manage their affairs like mad make ducks and drakes with huge sums of money and play the grand gentleman to achieve by storm a temporary credit which they manage to secure by some secret sacrifice When these daredevils once get going they heap blunder on blunder and usually end up in flight The affair will be excused as botch work and easily arranged for it provides material for mockery like the preceding one
These daredevils are extremely common in France and are here honoured with the title of speculators They are very sure of their game if they hasten the discovery so that they can turn their somersault at the very moment when they are believed to have hardly got going when everybody is ready to grant them credit for a first deal and thinks he will certainly not come a cropper in the very first year 
3 Stealthy bankruptcy the type carried out underhand is one in which the embarrassed debtor proposes a small arrangement a rebate of 25 per cent or coverage in goods to he over assessed by 25 per cent The mediator remarks to the creditors that this is very advantageous for them for if they press the debtor and oblige him to go bankrupt they will lose at least 50 per cent
This kind of relative calculation is very much insisted upon in trade One often comes across villains who after they have robbed you of 30 per cent try to prove that you are making an enormous profit because they are not fleecing you of 50 per cent Others maintain that they have to bear heavy losses because they are earning no more than 40 per cent on you and actually should be earning 60 per cent This apparently ridiculous way of reckoning is recognised everywhere in commerce it has its greatest triumph in underhand bankruptcy People insist that this small rebate of 25 per cent is a clear net profit compared with the 50 per cent that bankruptcy would cost Shaken by the force of this argument the creditors agree to the small arrangement He who was to receive 4000 francs gets 3000 and that is by no means called bankruptcy
4 Posthumous bankruptcy which is adjudicated after the heros death it becomes a plea in defence of the deceased who hoped to set his business in order again and would certainly have been a credit to it if he had but lived After that his excellent qualities are praised and his poor orphans sincerely pitied Surely the creditors will not wish to worry a tearful widow If she is beautiful that would be altogether barbaric Meanwhile the widow with the help of a few persons of trust has managed some sizeable defalcations before the sealing The deficiencies will be charged to the deceased who did not have time to put his affairs in order and who will not come back to disprove this little fib If there was a deficit of 25 per cent it will easily be increased to 50 per cent it does not cost any more once one has made a beginning besides how stupid it would he to go bankrupt with a 25 per cent deficit when people with one of 50 per cent are still considered honest especially when the fault lies with a highly respectable deceased person whose memory it would be abominable to discredit

The Honourable
The four species mentioned are those of fictitious innocence We no w let those of real innocence pass in review It would be unfair to brand bankrupts en masse because nine tenths of them are scoundrels I shall adduce three truly excusable classes We shall have but too many guilty ones to accuse so let us first seek some hone t people among this confraternity which has become so numerous since the revolution that in some towns one no longer asks who has but who has not gone bankrupt
5 Goose bankruptcy is that of an unfortunate one who does not peculate a mite hands everything over to the creditors and throws himself on their mercy without any deception The other bankrupts mock at him and declare him to be a simpletons for not at least feathering his nest and in fact such a loyal man is unworthy of our century of perfectibility 
6 Ecstatic bankruptcy is the work of a man who is desperate considers himself dishonoured and sometimes shoots himself or jumps into the water it means one is well behind the times if one wishes to be an honest man in the 19th century and moreover in trade
All the same it is a pleasure for me to have to say that one still comes across such people in trade but they are few and far between  rari nautes in gurgite vasto Rare swimmers in a vast gulf Virgil Aeneid Everybody foretells them their fate so well known is the fact that out of ten villains that plunge into trade nine make their fortune whereas out of ten honest people nine are ruined
7 Unprincipled bankruptcy is that of a booby who lets justice intervene and pronounce sentence branding him and stripping him naked instead of doing as so many clever people do who manage to emerge from this predicament with honour and profit These three honest knights are so little worthy of the exalted confraternity that I pass over them quickly We now come to a sort which is more capable of earning the applause of experts

The Seductive
Why should one not let oneself be seduced by bankrupts as one is by so many other wicked classes We shall now inspect a clique which possesses every kind of charm and is made to conquer all hearts
8 Amiability bankruptcy economical bankruptcy is that of a little man as sweet as honey who desires nothing but the good of his creditors would be desperate if he had to put them out of pocket and presses them to negotiate for 50 per cent in order to avoid the intervention of justice which would devour the lot He has the creditors notified that he wants to treat them as friends whose interests are dear to him Full of gratitude for the friendly services they have rendered him he trembles at the thought of having to cause them lawsuit costs These smooth words and other guiles seduce some while others yield for fear of justice swallowing up the lot
9 Bankruptcy de bon ton is that of people who are very much liked in refined society and maintain their household on an excellent footing till the last moment As they are comme ii faut in all respects they have abundant protection and when they are not at more than 60 per cent in deficit they easily get a composition especially when the lady and the daughters of the house can he used as pleaders and avail themselves of the decision of a Sanchez 216 who allows them to wear a very transparent scarf when they go soliciting in important matters
10 Amorous bankruptcy is that of pretty ladies it is not decent to complain about it the fair sex is entitled to consideration A pretty woman has a business goes bankrupts robs you of a thousand talers if you pester her it only goes to show that you have no savoir vivre she is right when she has no patience with the intractable I heard one such lady say about a creditor What a manl They even say he is still grumbling I advise him indeed to complain about his fifty louis I should have chalked him up for twice as much He had had certain intimacies with the lady she had the right to treat him as ungrateful
11 Bankruptcy by favour in the case of which it is obvious that the creditors derive profit  and how does that happen When the bankrupt steals only a little 40 per cent and provides security a very substantial caution for the rest This is considered so fortunate that the notary congratulates the assembled creditors congratulates them on an excellent piece of business a real favour To lose only four thousand francs out of ten thousand and to get six thousand paid back is a real advantage Somebody not accustomed to commerce would be unable to appreciate this favour he would want to have all of his ten thousand and would think he had been robbed of four thousand What bad manners To claim that a man robs you when he deducts 40 per cent discount and otherwise treats you in a friendly way
12 Sentimental bankruptcy occurs with certain people who deliver speeches to break your heart and pour out such floods of feeling and virtue over the creditor that he would be a barbarian if he did not instantly surrender did not esteem himself happy to oblige such fine people who tenderly love all those whose money they cause to disappear People of this kind pay with excellent excuses and very flattering eulogies they catch the creditor by his feelings converse with him only about his and their virtues you feel so much improved when the conversation is over you discover in yourself a multitude of virtues which amply outweigh the sum abstracted You have a few thousand francs less but all the more virtues it is a clear profit for beautiful souls
One of those actors said to me one day I was so sorry for the gentlemen they are very fine very respectable people  and the good young man as proof of his respect robbed them at once in the first deal with a bill of exchange which he gave them as a present and a token of welcome He had drawn the sum in order to come into contact with them and a month later he went bankrupt What a joy for these gentlemen to have received his respect as a security for ten thousand francs
I have kept my word I had promised a seductive company There is nothing but friendship favour bon ton and tender feelings in all bankruptcies of this truly amiable series But if it is calculated to win hearts others will command wonder give rise to brilliant upswings transcendent characters and represent the heroes of their genus

We now come to the magnificent manifestations of the spirit of commerce to the extensive operations which demonstrate the centurys immense progress towards rebirth and perfectibility Bankruptcy will here unfold its mastery and operate according to far reaching plans the exposition of which win prove the wisdom of the principle Let the merchants do their job leave them complete freedom for their lofty conceptions of deceit and plunder

The Tacticians
13 Fat bankruptcy is that of speculators of high standing who possess the genius of trade Banker Dorante 217 has two million and wishes to achieve as soon as possible by some means a fortune of four to five million By virtue of his known capital he receives credit amounting to eight million in bills of exchange goods etc so he has a fund of ten million to play with He plunges into grand speculation and deals in goods and state securities At the end of the year he may have lost his two million instead of doubling them you consider him as ruined  not at all he will have the four million just as if he had transacted good business for he still has the eight million that he has received and by means of an honest bankruptcy he arranges to pay half of this over several years SO it happens that after losing his own two million he finds himself in possession of four million that he has abstracted from the public What a wonderful thing this free trade Do you now grasp why one hears it said every day of a merchant He is doing very well since his bankruptcy
A further opportunity for the bankrupt Dorante after a peculation of four million retains intact his honour and public respect not as a lucky villain but as an unlucky merchant Let us explain this
Dorante obtained control over public opinion while he was pondering his bankruptcy his fêtes in town his country parties secured him warm supporters the gilded youth is for him the belles sympathise with his misfortune  misfortune today is a synonym for bankruptcy there is praise for his noble character which deserves a better lot It almost seems according to what his defenders say that the bankrupt has come off worse than those whose fortune he has destroyed It is all blamed on political events the unfavourable conditions and other verbiage current among notaries who are adepts at holding off attacks by irate creditors After the first storm Dorante brings in a few middlemen a few opportunely distributed wads of money and soon public opinion is so well hedged in that anybody who dares to speak against Dorante is declared to be a cannibal And besides those whom he robbed of the biggest sums are a hundred or two hundred miles away in Hamburg or in Amsterdam they will cool down in time they do not matter much their distant yapping does not affect opinion in Paris Moreover Dorante only causes them to lose half of their money and custom has it that he who steals only half is more unfortunate than guilty so that in the public mind Dorante stands clean from the start After a month public attention is diverted by other bankruptcies which create a bigger sensation and in which between two thirds and three quarters went west New splendour for Dorante who took only half and then it is an old forgotten story Dorantes house begins gradually to open to the public again his cook recovers his old sway over hearts and minds and unheeded are the cries of some black galled creditors who have no sympathy for misfortune and have no regard for the consideration due to good society
Thus in less than six months ends the operation by which Dorante and those of his kind rob the public of millions ruin families whose fortunes they hold in their hands hurl honest merchants into bankruptcy which assimilates them to villains Bankruptcy is the only social crime which spreads epidemically and plunges the honest man into the same disgrace as the rascal The more honest merchant who has suffered from the bankruptcies of twenty knaves is himself forced in the end to cease his payments
Hence it comes that the villainous bankrupts ie nine tenths of the tribe claim to be honest people who have been unfortunate and shout in chorus We are to be pitied more than blamed If you listen to them they are all little saints like galley slaves who all claim to have done nothing wrong
To this the supporters of free commerce will retort with talk of repressive laws of tribunals yes indeed Tribunals for people who steal several million at one go incidentally the saying that petty thieves are hanged while the big ones go scot free is false as regards trade for even the smallest bankruptcy evades justice under the protection of the merchants 
14 Cosmopolitan bankruptcy This is an alliance of the commercial mind with the philosophical A bankrupt is a true cosmopolite if after exploiting one kingdom he goes through a series of bankruptcies in several others This is a safe speculation On arrival one is unknown if necessary one changes ones name as Jews do and receives credit at once on the strength of the capital amassed as a result of an earlier bankruptcy it is a delightful idea of modern politics to hand over the general administration of the industrial product to people who are not tied by any solid link any big landed estate to their native country and who as cosmopolites can reckon on half a dozen successive bankruptcies in Paris London Hamburg Trieste Naples and Cadiz I shall depict this bankruptcy under the heading of running fire which has a cosmopolite as the pivotal point of its manoeuvre
15 Hopeful bankruptcy This dates really from after the revolution and is hardly half a century old Young people formerly did not make their debut in commerce so early they were never chiefs before their thirtieth year Now at the age of eighteen they run a house and at twenty they can have their first bankruptcy which justifies great hopes for the future There are some who before they are thirty have already been bankrupt three times and more than once got through one hundred talers belonging to their sleeping partner When one sees them one says he is very young to have such fame but we are living in the age of young people
16 Transcendent bankruptcy requires a far reaching plan an immense upswing an office with thirty to forty clerks numerous ships colossal interests in all countries then a sudden crash a terrible somersault the counterblasts of which echo in the four corners of the world and a chaos of liquidations on the fat of which businessmen can thrive for ten years It is an operation in which the mercantile genius is unfolded in all its brilliance it must entail a loss of at least three quarters for in this mighty picture everything must he laid out magnificently
17 Graded bankruptcy is that of a speculator who by wisely directing his operation can achieve a career of seven or eight successive bankruptcies In this case he must adopt a different course than the one who aims at only one or two
The principles are
1 in the first bankruptcy to plunder only with measure 50 per cent is sufficient one must not make the people wild from the start and the second bankruptcy would be too difficult if one discredited oneself at the first trial stroke through too great covetousness
2 in the second bankruptcy to plunder only very little not more than 30 per cent in order to prove that the bankrupt has learned something that he already operates more skilfully and cautiously and that he will become an accomplished merchant a worthy friend of trade  when he has recovered from this second blow
3 in the third to plunder abundantly at least 80 per cent claiming that it is no ordinary deficit but one caused by extraordinary mischance to see it through by pleading some critical circumstances to draw attention to ones good behaviour in the second bankruptcy in order to prove that the blame lies entirely with events
4 in the fourth to plunder only 50 per cent in order to prove that one is a cautious man and knows how to remain within the appropriate bounds when not swept away by circumstances
5 in the fifth one can go as far as 60 per cent because the public is accustomed to it 10 per cent more or less spoils no speculation of this kind when public opinion has become accustomed to it for it is known that whoever has had four bankruptcies will also have a fifth and a sixth I have seen one bankrupt who was laughed at after his fourth bankruptcy because he wore a clerical hat as a sign of piety and good morals he did not let himself be put off and prepared the fifth
The sixth and seventh are ad libitum one has them only as age draws on and when one thinks of resting on ones laurels Nothing is easier than to excuse a sixth bankruptcy one is too old to change nobody is surprised any longer For the rest it is argued that the government refuses to protect trade and is the cause of these little setbacks of honest businessmen
Let no one be surprised if I give here a few principles to he used in bankruptcy it is a quite new art which like economics from which it sprang has as yet no fixed principles nor even a methodical nomenclature For instance titles have been given only to she first four stages in graded bankruptcy
The man who has had his first bankruptcy is simply a Knight At the second he receives the title of Prince
At the third the title of King
At the fourth Emperor
For the fifth sixth and seventh grade there are not yet any names among the members of the trade A true friend of trade must rise to the full octave In order to be a harmonious bankrupt one must have had seven honest bankruptcies with average losses of 50 per cent and then a reinforced a complete bankruptcy as the pivotal point in the series it is then allowed to plunder to the extent of at least 80 per cent as an indemnity for the moderation shown in the others the fifty per cent of earlier bankruptcies is only the honest tariff a quite small slice giving nobody the right to censure because it is the accepted rate for bankruptcies a fixed price exactly like the price of tartlets or coach fares

The Manoeuvrers
In this item we deal with the mass evolutions which require co operation of different bankrupts for the good of trade and the triumph of lofty truth These collective manoeuvres will show us four sorts of evolution artists
18 Running fire bankruptcy This is generally caused by counterblasts through a concatenation of bankruptcies one caused by another I shall describe one of the medium sort the bourgeois kind because they are most understandable for the bulk of readers We shall take one of the cosmopolitan artists whose definition I have postponed as the pivotal point of the running fire manoeuvre
Judas Iscariot arrives in France 218 with 100000 francs capital which he earned in his first bankruptcy he establishes himself as a merchant in a town their clientele and their good reputation Iscariot immediately begins to sell his where he has six respected and accredited houses as rivals In order to take away wares at cost price a sure way of attracting the multitude Soon his rivals clamour in a most pitiful way about him he laughs at their complaints and continues all the more to sell off everything at cost price
Thereupon the people shout so that it is a pleasure to hear them Long live competition long five the Jews long live philosophy and fraternity All commodities have become cheaper since Iscariots arrival and the public say to his rivals You Gentlemen are the real Jews you want to earn too much Iscariot alone is an honest man he is content with a moderate profit because he runs no brilliant household as you do  Vain are all the representations made by the old houses that Iscariot is a villain in disguise who sooner or later will come to grief the public accuse them of jealousy and calumny and crowd more and more to the Jew
The calculation that this thief makes is as follows By selling at cost price he loses only the interest on his capital let it come to 10000 francs annually but ensures a good outlet for himself makes a name for himself in the maritime towns as a good consumer and by prompt payment gets big credit This trick is pursued for two years after which Iscariot has earned nothing though he has sold enormous quantities His manoeuvre remains undetected because Jews have only Jewish office staff people who are the secret enemies of all nations and will never betray a villainy thought up by their own people
When all is ripe for development Iscariot puts in his whole credit places giant orders in all maritime towns buys goods on credit for the sum of 5 600000 francs He sends his wares abroad and sells his whole stock dirt cheap When he has exchanged everything for money the good Iscariot vanishes with his briefcase and returns to Germany where he has despatched the goods he bought on credit sells them quickly and is four times as rich when he leaves France as he was on his arrival he has 400000 francs and he goes to London or Leghorn to get a third bankruptcy under way
Now the veil suddenly falls and people come to their senses in the town where he struck his blow People realise how dangerous it is to permit Jews to trade those vagabonds who are not tied to anything But this bankruptcy of Iscariot is only the first act of the farce let us follow the running fire
The Jew has six rivals we shall call them A B C D E F
A had been in straits for a long time he held out without capital only by virtue of his good reputation but through the arrival of the Jew he is robbed of all his clients he could pursue the race only for a year and not mature for these new philosophical systems which protect vagabonds he finds himself compelled to bow down before Iscariots tactics and to declare himself bankrupt
B endured the blow longer he already saw the Jews villainy from afar and waited for the storm to pass in order to win back his clientele which the rascal Iscariot had taken away But meanwhile he is involved in a bankruptcy abroad that ugh to accelerate his fall he thought he could hold out for two years but he is is obliged to go bankrupt after only fifteen months
C was associated with a foreign house which is ruined by another Iscariot  for they are to be found in all towns C is brought down by the fall of his associate and after making sacrifices for eighteen months to hold out against the competition from the Jewish blackguard he finds himself forced to go bankrupt
D seems more honest than he is in reality He still has the means to hold out although he has been suffering from the Jews competition for twenty months but embittered by the losses which the latter has caused him he lets himself be carried away by the vice of which he sees so many examples He realiws that three of his confraternity have opened up the march and that he will pass as a fourth in the alliance pretexting real or fictitious misfortunes Thus D wearied by twenty months of struggle against Iscariot sees that there is nothing cleverer for him than to go bankrupt
E had advanced considerable sums to his four successively bankrupt colleagues he thought they were all solvent and they were indeed until Iscariots manoeuvre spoilt their business for them E finds himself stripped by the bankruptcies of these four houses besides he himself has no more clients the entire public crowd to Iscariot who sells off goods at cost price E sees his funds annihilated his credit destroyed he is pressed and as he can no more meet his commitments he puts an end to it by going bankrupt
F has sufficient means but as a result of the five previous bankruptcies which warrant the conclusion that his will soon follow he has lost his credit in all the maritime towns Moreover some of the bankrupts having achieved a composition are now selling at very low prices to he able to afford their payments when the first terms expire In order to accelerate their sales they lose orie tenth of the value and yet earn four tenths because they settled at 50 per cent This entirely crushes F and there is nothing left for him but to go bankrupt like his rivals
So the establishment of one vagabond or one Jew is sufficient to disorganise the whole merchant body of a large town and to draw the most honest people into crime for every bankruptcy is more or less a crime no matter how much it is extenuated by excellent pretexts such as those with which I have tinted these six bankruptcies and there is hardly ever a word of truth in any of them The truth of the matter is that everybody avidly seizes the opportunity to commit a theft if it remains unpunished
Occasionally running fire takes the form of ricochet fire which is effective at a distance and involves a dozen houses in different countries simultaneously They have common interests and the fall of the main house causes all the subsidiary houses concerned to crash like a row of tin soldiers when the man at the end of the row is pushed This is a serious combination worthy of figuring among the great manoeuvres and in any case this ricochetting at a distance will have to form a special genus in a more accurate classification
19 Close column bankruptcy requires favourable circumstances which serve as excuses and prompt masses of merchants to risk the fateful leap In this case they find support one in the other and are saved because of their number like a regiment in close column formation forces a way for itself with bayonets Thus when a favourable opportunity presents itself bankrupts must close their ranks and post up a column of bankruptcies every day at the Stock Exchange they must have them succeeding one another so quickly that public opinion is confused and compositions become easy to achieve in consideration of the difficult circumstances These bankruptcies are seen occurring periodically in London Paris too made a very beautiful attempt in close column in 1800 and it ended very happily for many friends of trade
20 March in file bankruptcy is a series of bankruptcies which are linked together but break out at suitable intervals of two to three months Contrary to the close columns which follow one another day after day marching in file bankruptcies require mutual agreement so that one goes bankrupt when ones turn comes at the very instant when the predecessor has squared his composition For instance A has achieved his composition three months after bankruptcy and B must instantaneously declare himself insolvent because the mediators now find the public well disposed and can say it is the same story as in the case of A one was bound to lead to the other the same composition must be made Just the same for C who will go bankrupt three months later then D E F and G if they maintain their co operation properly and succeed in keeping to the interval they achieve the same composition for all Marching in file is a very safe manoeuvre when it is cleverly directed but it does not fit all circumstances and only the genius of the prospective bankrupt can determine in which cases it is applicable
21 Skirmisher bankruptcy involves at the start those starving wretches who initiate a great movement and here and there cause small bankruptcies in their retail trade From this one concludes that business will be difficult and the campaign a fierce one And indeed soon after that the heavy artillery is heard bankruptcies involving millions break out and hold public attention for a long time Then the movement ends with the rearguard skirmishers the retailer bankrupts the grocers in small towns who bring the session to an end with their plunges

The Agitators
What Is there not yet enough vexation and can you show us something still worse than the litany already described
I have only named the most honest We are approaching the descending despicable wing and can place here the bankrupts who operate according to far reaching plans but disregard moral methods and compromise the lofty corporation
22 Bankruptcy in grand style affects all classes of society down to the smallest people domestics and others who deposit their modest savings with a hypocrite Soon bankruptcy plunders landowners the smaller middle class and the goodnatured people in their hundreds An entire town becomes involved In general this type of bankruptcy affects particularly the non trading classes of society and does significant harm to the corporation by arousing in the people and the petty bourgeoisie reflections which are hardly flattering for the respectable confraternity of the merchants
23 Large scale bankruptcy is that of some obscure upstart who without funds or backing succeeds in breaking into big business and pulls off just as enormous a bankruptcy as the high and mighty bankers It is generally wondered how this camp follower could manage to strike up such acquaintances and to organise such a fat bankruptcy
This individual is the opposite of the preceding one he takes a different road to attain the same goal namely to excite public opinion against the tricks of the merchants and the preposterous laws which leave this scum complete freedom
24 Attila bankruptcy raises the fame of the bankrupts to the clouds and lays a country waste as if a whole army of vandals had swept across it One can cite in this genus a brilliant bankruptcy pulled off in 1810 in Orleans by an amateur named T He went bankrupt with a deficit of 16 million so excellently distributed over Orleans that the whole unfortunate town was laid low by it All classes of citizens suffered from the devastation Fugitives went as far as Lyons and spread the tidings Orleans is destroyed we are all ruined T is plunging everything into the abyss
According to detailed reports he had carried out his scheme so well that he had hoodwinked and plundered all classes from rich capitalists to poor domestics who had saved a few talers in their whole life and deposited them with the mercantile dealer and let themselves he robbed by him  under the protection of the fine principle Let the merchants do their job they know best what is in their interest
What robberies What multiformity of crime in a single branch of commercial heroism A single one for let it be noted that bankruptcy is only the thirty first feature of this lying trade for which science demands complete freedom under the pretext that the merchants know best what is in their interest they know that indeed all too well but they know only too little what is in the interest of the state and of industry and so we are mystified by science and its theories on the absolute freedom of merchants

VI
Descending Wing Dirty Hues
From the description of great feats of heroism we go on to more modest trophies Not everything is great in bankruptcy like the three categories of the centre Still in the left wing too we shall bring together a remarkable collection bankrupts in softened shades people whose more burgherly virtues and failings will do good to the eye after the vivid brilliance of so many heroic deeds we shall still find cohorts capable of cheering the reader  especially the last that of the false brothers who bring ill fame on the corps of bankrupts  Let us begin with a more serious hue

The Cunning Sneakers
25 Compensation bankruptcy is declared to obtain compensation for some accident For instance a speculator loses a lawsuit today which costs him 100000 francs So tomorrow he declares himself bankrupt and this brings him 200000 Thus he wins the sum in litigation instead of losing it This capacity of trade to compensate itself for the disfavour of circumstances is one of its finest qualities it can find its interest in every mishap on land and sea If a shipowner experiences a shipwreck he rehabilitates himself the next day by a good bankruptcy and this type of bankruptcy is accepted without any contradiction because the notary says It is not his fault events forced him to it he is more to be pitied than blamed 
To this a landowner whose deposit thus goes west will answer I cannot get compensation when hail or a flood ruin my crops I have nobody to fall back on  A fine argument Should not landowners know that under the present order of things they are a dependent class dependent on the unproductive people called merchants who dig their claws into every product of industry to get themselves paid at the expense of the masses like a volunteer corps which for lack of an enemy to plunder strips its own friends And the good people Such is the merchant a veritable cossack of industry whose motto is I do not work pour la gloire I must have something to rake in Every merchant wants to rake in and if somebody hopes to rake anything in from him by a lawsuit or otherwise the merchant has his resources at hand and rakes in from others by means of a compensation bankruptcy
26 Bankruptcy out of rank is that of a wise man who has foreseen everything and put something aside with which he can face the storm and tame the intractable if he wants to earn 200000 francs by bankruptcy he puts 300000 aside placing a third of it in useful hand outs presents etc he knows how to quieten the most loud mouthed how to paralyse justice a wad here a wad there and his case is briskly carried through His bankruptcy brings him in the end a good number of friends who get their piece of the cake and say that he is a man comma if faut who knows business inside out
27 Crescendo bankruptcy plays a farce in several acts which increase in interest as they develop To start with the affair is presented as a slight embarrassment a case of shortage of disposable capital with a discount of 30 per cent necessary to prevent a crash ne creditors become worried and negotiate on the quiet for they have been given to understand that things could take a bad turn and that the man in question must be supported Meanwhile in three months he is tottering again Again the creditors are visited and made to fear his ruin it is admitted that things are worse than was thought and that 50 per cent must be agreed to Some of the creditors are vexed the matter becomes entangled and bankruptcy is declared  and indeed on such terms that 80 90 per cent is lost instead of 50 per cent and the rest can be paid up only after some years But the composition is still easy to bring about because the creditors who have been skilfully handled and have successively become accustomed to a loss of 30 then 50 then 70 per cent are weary of war they sign and give the cursed business up as altogether lost although it was said at the beginning that only 30 per cent was going to be lost This method is not the worst and can he recommended to speculators who stick to principles
28 Godly bankruptcy is that of a holy man who belongs to all the confraternities and holds the cordon of the canopy at processions 219 He easily finds credit and depositors and can prepare a far reaching bankruptcy underhand I have seen some bankruptcies of this type when the loss was 90 per cent The advantage in such a case is that the bankrupt finds enough people who excuse him Ah he is a very pious man if he has had no luck in business it Is because he sets no store by the goods of this world  This piety is held up in order to hasten the composition by which the pious apostle retains a good part of the goods of this world together with the prospects of those of the other

The Bunglers
In every profession one finds ignoramuses who work without any principles and can produce only a bad job with the best material So among bankrupts too there are dunces who can do nothing else but change gold into copper and ruin themselves in a very stupid manner where others would do splendid business I want to adduce and deal briefly with four genera for this really honest category has nothing entertaining I only let them march past for the sake of completeness of our analysis
29 Fools bankruptcy is that of those befooled people who enticed by fashionable catchwords venture into trade without knowing its tricks and naturally scorch their wings like moths in the candlelight Since 1789 there have been many big property owners who had no need whatever to get involved in this turmoil they have been seen to lose a rich heritage and end up in bankruptcy by which they parted with  their fortune and their honour It must be noted incidentally that only the honest man loses his honour in bankruptcy whereas the rascal who knows the great principles of trade can manage his bankruptcies in such a way that he acquires wealth and honour But the great gentlemen who found themselves in this wasps nest of trade wanted to negotiate honestly they were surrounded by intriguers played with like a ball and forced to end up with the bankruptcy of their illusions Many small landowners have made the same mistake Swept along by the mercantile race they have abandoned their field sold their small plot of land to set up a shop in town and meet their inevitable ruin
30 Invalids bankruptcy is that of an incorrigible who wants to die with arms in hand One sees many who ought to retire and who weakened by age can do nothing but bungle are ignorant of the latest achievements and in their old age lose a slowly amassed fortune and obstinately hold out until repeated blunders make bankruptcy inevitable How is one to describe a man of eighty who is a bachelor and has a fortune of two million indeed sufficient for a single and aged man and still obstinately continues huckstering at an age when he should retire and weep over his sins When such a man gets himself ruined and loses his brilliant fortune in his eightieth year he is truly a mercantile fanatic Such a man was the invalid bankrupt who is the prototype of this paragraph for I have a prototype to show for all these species* so that I shall not be accused of exaggerating Incidentally many of these aged fanatics are to he found in every town because they insist on continuing their trade they deserve to be shamefully ruined for today when everything is raised to its quintessence the need in trade as in war is for young people educated in modern tactics and if bankruptcy is regarded as a harmless game for young people it is indeed shameful for wealthy old men who should have thought of retiring twenty years ago
31 Crushing bankruptcy is that of enraged competitors who consciously rush towards ruin and indeed ruin themselves to dispute a small share of profit from a rival One sees a great number of these who work at a loss in the hope that their rival will be ruined before they are and that they themselves win remain masters of the battlefield This disorder is prevalent particularly in the carrying trade and in the cloth markets such as Beaucaire220 and it leads to the crushed being forced to go bankrupt
32 Swinish bankruptcy is that of a greenhorn who instead of operating according to the principles ruins himself his wife and children and moreover exposes himself to the talons of justice and the contempt of the friends of trade who respect only fat bankrupts who conform to the principles In the jargon of commercial knaves they say of a bankrupt who thus ruins himself his wife and children That is indeed really swinish If he had had a fat bankruptcy they would have called him a smart young man a clever brain

The False Brothers
I give the name of false brothers to those who expose the honourable clan of the bankrupts to the contempt of the public Some of them provoke indignation others laughter I do not include in this class the transcendents who steal by the million  these are always respectable and never compromise the clan a great thief has never been contemptible in civilisation whereas the small ones are the people to be hanged and when they excite public opinion against villains and small bankruptcies they are unworthy of admission to the corporation and deserve to be styled as false brothers
33 Villains bankruptcy is that of small scale blackguards who commit such obnoxious petty thefts in their bankruptcy that the neighbourhood says they ought to be hanged That would not be the case with thefts of 100000 talers but thefts of 100 talers suggest the idea of the gallows incidentally these ideas are not dangerous for the knave because the confraternity of the bankruptsb never allows its colleagues to he molested otherwise justice would soon feel authorised to pass on from the petty thieves to the big ones which would be very awkward for those who act according to great principles and have found a place in good society after an honest bankruptcy
34 Gallows bird bankruptcy is that by which besides dirty tricks the man concerned commits also learned acts of perfidy for instance robs himself to provide an occasion for sentimental tactics
Scapin a petty crook 221 indulges in a scaramouch bankruptcy involving only 40000 francs he steals 30000 francs which constitutes the profit on the operation and then offers the creditors the remainder amounting to 10000 francs When he is asked about the deficit of 30000 francs he says that he does not know book keeping like big merchants and that he has been unlucky Perhaps you believe Scapin will be punished because he is a petty thief who steals only 30000 francs  but do not the creditors know that if justice intervenes it will eat up the remaining 10000 francs just for breakfast And even when these 10000 francs have disappeared nothing will he settled if they want to have Scapin hanged it will cost them perhaps an additional 10000 francs and it is still not known whether they will succeed It is therefore better in any case to accept the moderate sum of 10000 francs than to lose it and still have to pay just as much over and above Through his notary Scapin puts forward this argument so that the bankrupt himself threaten his creditors with justice And why should Scapins creditors he furious with him Some of them think of following his noble example the others are already ahead of him in their career So as wolf does not eat wolf Scapin soon finds a number of signatories who declare themselves satisfied with his proposals others sign for fear that justice may intervene others again are intractable and speak of sacrificing all to have a blackguard sent to the galleys Then Scapin sends them his wife and children who implore his mercy with well practised wailings and so in a few days Scapin and his notary receive the majority of signatures Thereupon the obstreperous who are no longer needed are made fun of Their rage is laughed at Scapin answers them with ingratiating words and profound bows and immediately after the happy issue of the first bankruptcy he starts to think of a new one
35 Fugitive bankruptcy is customary among small tenants in large towns As the date of payment approaches they bolt and bring their wretched movables to safety under cover of the night It is very much in vogue among the silk weavers in Lyons it is also resorted to by all elegant individuals of both sexes who order the very best things at restaurants the tailors and the shoe makers and are very accommodating as far as the price goes because they intend to pay with fine words and to bolt as soon as their creditors begin to get unpleasant
This kind of bankruptcy is droll and shows the corporation in a bad light When one scoffs at a man who has cheated twenty petty shopkeepers one easily becomes accustomed to scoffing at a man comme il faut whose bankruptcy ruins twenty families These freedoms of criticism must be suppressed in order not to imperil the respect due to the honourable bankrupts among the friends of trade
36 Bankruptcy for fun is that of a small retailer who goes bankrupt according to the very best form just like the high and mighty bankers and does not give his creditors more than five per cent Among others a Lyons actor distinguished for his comical roles and therefore very much loved by the public went bankrupt in this way In all due form he offered his creditors the sum of three per cent Some of them were vexed and wanted to send the bailiff to him but he mystified justice as he mystified it on the stage in the Avocat Patelin and all the public were on his side His bankruptcy was a highly amusing comedy which afforded many a priceless scene The creditors could swear the public only laughed at them as they did at Guillaume in the Avocat Patelin
I have now gone rapidly through all these definitions However my list is so incomplete that it can be considered as a mere outline to which everybody can supply the missing features There are masses of remarkable ones Only a few days ago the Paris papers reported a brilliant bankruptcy that of a certain Y who established a pompously publicised agency with no more than 10000 francs I believe it was an office for the regeneration of trade or some other pompous title by means of  which he obtained a million from a few jackanapes whom he paid as usual with a good bankruptcy In a word the number of bankruptcy genera which I have collected here can easily be doubled

Conclusion
When one reflects that bankruptcy is only a single one of the thirty six features of trade one finds difficulty in explaining why this so fearful mine of crimes this mechanism of trade has not yet been analysed and that in this century which is so uncompromising towards the crimes of all classes in society and has made public the crimes of kings and popes
When one reads this collection of merchants filth one cannot help wondering how it comes that a century which calls itself the friend of lofty truth has been able in all seriousness to grow enthusiastic over this lying trade arguing that after all one cannot do without trade as if for that reason one must accept fraud and theft such as those which we have listed in one single crime of trade namely bankruptcy
However let us finish what we have to say about this
The saying that justice sends only petty thieves to the gallows is proved false in trade The bankrupt even the smallest evades prosecution protected by the merchants themselves We saw that under the last category  false brothers which is that of miniature bankrupts
It would be vain to quote the punishment of a few fraudulent bankrupts ninety nine manage to get away with it and if the hundredth fails he must be a stupid devil and not know how to pursue his intrigue For the operation is so simple nowadays that the old precautionary measures have long ago been forgotten Formerly a bankrupt used to flee to Trient Liege or Carouge but since the rebirth of 1789 this custom has been abandoned Everybody now goes bankrupt en famille The matter is quietly prepared and when it explodes one goes for a month to the country to the intimacy of ones relatives and friends the notary meanwhile puts everything in order After a few weeks one reappears and the public is so accustomed to this kind of story that it regards it as a pleasant joke it is called being confined and one says quite dispassionately So and so is back he has just had his confinement
I have noted that bankruptcy is the only social crime which becomes epidemical and forcibly carries the honest man along the road of the scoundrel If to bankruptcy we add stockjobbing and so many other infamies we shall find that I was right when I affirmed that civilised people had never committed so many political follies as since they plunged into trade Never have the philosophers who dream of nothing but counterbalance and guarantees thought of providing the social body with the guarantee which governments judiciously enough demand of their fiscal agents A prince assures himself of the rectitude of his treasurer by means of a cash security and the prospect of inevitable punishment if he were to dare risk or squander the public monies deposited with him Why does it not happen that the collectors of public monies appropriate the revenues from taxes and write letters of lamentation to the government saying The misfortunes of the times the critical circumstances the deplorable accidents etc in a word I have gone bankrupt insolvent or whatever you call it Your treasury should contain ten million I offer you half of that sum five million payable in five years Allow yourself to be moved by the misfortune of a lamentable treasurer maintain me in your confidence and the administration of your treasury without which I am not even able to pay you the half which I now offer you but if you leave me my position and my income I shall endeavour to discharge my obligations towards you honourably that is to treat you to a second bankruptcy as soon as the treasury is full again
Such in brief is the content of all bankrupts letters If treasurers do not follow this example it is because they know that no philosophical theory can save them from the punishment which the bankrupt evades under the protection of the principle Leave the merchants complete freedom without demanding any guarantee against their machinations

All those philosophical whims called duties have no relation whatever to Nature duty
    proceeds from men Attraction proceeds from God now if we desire to know the designs of
    God we must study Attraction Nature only without any regard to duty which varies with
    every age while the nature of the passions has been and will remain invariable among all
    nations of men
The learned world is wholly imbued with a doctrine termed MORALITY which is a mortal
    enemy of passional attraction 
Morality teaches man to be at war with himself to resist his passions to repress
    them to believe that God was incapable of organizing our souls our passions wisely that
    he needed the teachings of Plato and Seneca in order to know how to distribute
    characteristics and instincts Imbued with these prejudices regarding the impotence of
    God the learned world was not qualified to estimate the natural impulses or passional
    attractions which morality proscribes and relegates to the rank of vices 
It is true that these impulses entice us only to evil if we yield to them
    individually but we must calculate their effect upon a body of about two thousand persons
    socially combined and not upon families or isolated individuals this is what the learned
    world has not thought of in studying it it would have recognized that as soon as the
    number of associates  societaires has reached 1600 the natural impulses termed
    attractions tend to form series of contrasting groups in which everything incites to
    industry become attractive and to virtue become lucrative
The passions believed to be the enemies of concord in reality conduce to that unity
    from which we deem them so far removed But outside of the mechanism termed exalted
    emulatory interlocked  engrenees Series they are
    but unchained tigers incomprehensible enigmas It is this which has caused philosophers
    to say that we ought to repress them an opinion doubly absurd inasmuch as we can only
    repress our passions by violence or absorbing replacement which
    replacement is no repression On the other hand should they be efficiently repressed the
    civilized order would rapidly decline find relapse into the nomad state where the
    passions would still be malevolent as with us The virtue of shepherds is as doubtful as
    that of their apologists and our utopia makers by thus attributing virtues to imaginary
    peoples only succeed in proving the impossibility of introducing virtue into
    civilization 
We are quite familiar with the five sensitive passions tending to Luxury the
    four affective ones tending to Groups it only remains for us to learn about the
    three distributive ones whose combined impulse produces Series a social
    method of which the secret has been lost since the age of primitive mankind who were
    unable to maintain the Series more than about 300 years
The four affective passions tending to form the four groups of friendship
    love ambition paternity or consanguinity are familiar enough but no analyses or
    parallels or scales have been made of them 
The three others termed distributive are totally misunderstood and bear only the
    title of vices although they are infinitely precious for these three possess the
    property of forming and directing the series of groups the mainspring of social harmony
    Since these series are not formed in the civilized order the three distributive passions
    cause disorder only Let us define them

10th THE CABALIST is the passion that like love has the property of confounding
    ranks drawing superiors and inferiors closer to each other Everyone must recall
    occasions when he has been strongly drawn into some Path followed with complete success 
For instance electoral cabal to elect a certain candidate cabal on Change in the
    stock jobbing game cabal of two pairs of lovers planning a partie carree
    without the fathers knowledge a family cabal to secure a desirable match If these
    intrigues are crowned with success the participants become friends in spite of some
    anxiety they have passed happy moments together while conducting the intrigue the
    emotions it arouses are necessities of the soul 
Far removed from the insipid calm whose charms are extolled by morality the cabalistic
    spirit is the true destination of man Plotting doubles his resources enlarges his
    faculties Compare the tone of a formal social gathering its moral stilted languishing
    jargon with the tone of these same people united in a cabal they will appear transformed
    to you you will admire their terseness their animation the quick play of ideas the
    alertness of action of decision in a word the rapidity of the spiritual or material
    motion This fine development of the human faculties is the fruit of the cabalist or tenth
    passion which constantly prevails in the labors and the reunions of a passionate series 
As it always results in some measure of success and as its groups are all precious to
    each other the attraction of the cabals becomes a potent bond of friendship between all
    the sectaires even the most unequal
The general perfection of industry will spring then from the passion which is most
    condemned by the philosophers the cabalist or dissident which has never been able to
    obtain among us the rank of a passion notwithstanding that it is so strongly rooted even
    in the philosophers themselves who are the greatest intriguers in the social world 
The cabalist is a favorite passion of women they are excessively fond of intrigue the
    rivalries and all the greater and lesser flights of a cabal It is a proof of their
    eminent fitness  for the new social order where cabals without number will be needed in
    every series periodical schisms in order to maintain a movement of coming and going
    among the sectaries of the different groups 

12th THE COMPOSITE  This passion requires in every action a composite allurement or
    pleasure of the senses and of the soul and consequently the blind enthusiasm which is
    born only of the mingling of the two kinds of pleasure These conditions are but little
    compatible with civilized labor which far from offering any allurement either to the
    senses or the soul is only a double torment even in the most vaunted of work shops such
    as the spinning factories of England where the people even the children work fifteen
    hours a day under the lash in premises devoid of air 
The composite is the most beautiful of the twelve passions the one which enhances the
    value of all the others A love is not beautiful unless it is a composite love combining
    the charm of the senses and of the soul It becomes trifling or deception if it limits
    itself to one of these springs An ambition is not vehement unless it brings into play the
    two springs glory and interest It is then that it becomes capable of brilliant efforts
The composite commands so great a respect that all are agreed in despising
    people inclined to simple pleasure Let a man provide himself with fine viands fine
    wines with the intention of enjoying them alone of giving himself up to gormandizing by
    himself and he exposes himself to well merited gibes But if this man gathers a select
    company in his house where one may enjoy at the same time the pleasure of the senses by
    good cheer and the pleasure of the soul by companionship he will be lauded because
    these banquets will be a composite and not a simple pleasure 
If general opinion despises simple material pleasure the same is true as well of
    simple spiritual pleasure of gatherings where there is neither refreshment nor dancing
    nor love nor anything for the senses where one enjoys oneself only in imagination Such
    a gathering devoid of the composite or pleasure of the senses and the soul becomes
    insipid to its participants and it is not long before it grows bored and
    dissolves 

11th THE PAPILLONNE Butterfly or Alternating Although eleventh according
    to rank it should be examined after the twelfth because it serves as a link between the
    other two the tenth and the twelfth If the sessions of the series were meant to be
    prolonged twelve or fifteen hours like those of civilized workmen who from morning till
    night stupefy themselves by being engaged in insipid duties without any
    diversion God would have given us a taste for monotony an abhorrence of variety But as
    the sessions of the series are to be very short and the enthusiasm inspired by the
    composite is incapable of being prolonged beyond an hour and a half God in conformity to
    this industrial order had to endow us with the passion of papillonnage the
    craving for periodic variety in the phases of life and for frequent variety in our
    occupations Instead of working twelve hours with a scant intermission for a poor dull
    dinner the associative state will never extend its sessions of labor beyond an hour and a
    half or at most two besides it will diffuse a host of pleasures reunions of the two
    sexes terminating in a repast from which one will proceed to new diversions with
    different company and cabals 
Without this hypothesis of associative labor arranged in the order I have described
    it would be impossible to conceive for what purpose God should have given us three
    passions so antagonistic to the monotony experienced in civilization and so unreasonable
    that in the existing state they have not even been accorded the rank of passions but
    are termed only vices 
A series on the contrary could not be organized without the permanent cooperation of
    these three passions They are bound to intervene constantly and simultaneously in the
    serial play of intrigue Hence it comes that these three passions could not be discerned
    until the invention of the serial mechanism and that up to that time they had to be
    regarded as vices When the social order for which God has destined us shall be known in
    detail it will be seen that these pretended vices the Cabalist the Papillonne the
    Composite become there three pledges of virtue and riches that God did indeed know
    how to create passions such as are demanded by social unity that He would have been wrong
    to change them in order to please Seneca and Plato that on the contrary human reason
    ought to strive to discover a social condition which shall be in affinity with these
    passions No moral theory will ever change them and in accordance with the rules of the
    duality of tendency they will intervene for ever to lead us TO EVIL in the disjointed
    state or social limbo and TO GOOD in the regime of association or serial labor 
The seven affective and distributive passions depend more upon
    the spirit than upon matter they rank as PRIMITIVES Their combined action engenders a
    collective passion or one formed by the union of the other seven as white is formed by
    the union of the seven colors of a ray of light I shall call this thirteenth passion
    Harmonism or Unityism it is even less known than the tenth eleventh
    and twelfth of which I have not spoken 
Unityism is the inclination of the individual to reconcile his own happiness
    with that of all surrounding him and of all human kind to day so odious It is an
    unbounded philanthropy a universal good will which can only be developed when the entire
    human race shall be rich free and just
Questions regarding gallantly and the love of eating are treated facetiously by the
    Civilized who do not comprehend the importance that God attaches to our pleasures
    Voluptuousness is the sole arm which God can employ to master us and lead us to carry out
    his designs he rules the universe by Attraction and not by Force therefore the
    enjoyments of his creatures are the most important object of the calculations of God
I shall in order to dispose others to share my confidence explain the object of one
    of these impulses accounted as vicious 
I select a propensity which is the most general and the most thwarted by education it
    is the gluttony of children their fondness for dainties in opposition to the advice of
    the pedagogues who counsel them to like bread to eat more bread than their allowance 
Nature then is very clumsy to endow children with tastes so opposed to sound
    doctrines every child regards a breakfast of dry bread as a punishment he would wish for
    sugared cream sweetened milk food and pastry marmalades and stewed fruit raw and
    preserved fruit lemonades and orangeades mild white wines Let us observe closely these
    tastes which prevail among all children on this point a great case is to be adjudged the
    question to be determined is who is wrong God or morality 
God dispenser of attraction gives all children a liking for dainties it was in his
    power to give them a liking for dry bread and water it would have suited the views of
    morality why then does he knowingly militate against sound civilized doctrines Let us
    explain these motives 
God has given children a liking for substances which will be the least costly in the
    associative state When the entire globe shall be populated and cultivated enjoying
    free trade exempt from all duties the sweet viands mentioned above will be much less
    expensive than bread the abundant edibles will be fruit milk foods and sugar but not
    bread whose price will be greatly raised because the labor incident to the growing of
    grain and the daily making of bread is wearisome and little attractive these kinds of
    labor would have to be paid much higher than that in orchards or confectioneries 
And as it is fitting that the food and maintenance of children should involve less
    expense than those of their parents God has acted judiciously in attracting them to those
    sweetmeats and dainties which will be cheaper than bread as soon as we shall have entered
    upon the associative state Then the sound moral doctrines will be found to be altogether
    erroneous concerning the nourishment of children as well as upon all other points which
    oppose attraction It will be recognized that God did well what he did that he
    was right in attracting children to milk foods fruit and sweet pastries and that
    instead of foolishly losing three thousand years in declaiming against Gods wisest work
    against the distribution of tastes and passionate attractions it would have been better
    to study its aim by reckoning with all those impulses combined which morality insults
    singly under the pretext that they are hurtful to the civilized and barbarous orders
    this is true but God did not create the passions for the civilized and barbarous orders
    If he had wished to maintain these two forms of society exclusively he would have given
    children a fondness for dry bread and to the parents a love of poverty since that is the
    lot of the immense majority of mankind in civilization and barbarism
In the civilized state love of eating does not ally itself to industry because the laboring
    producer does not enjoy the commodities which he has cultivated or manufactured This
    passion therefore becomes an attribute of the idle and through that alone it would be
    vicious were it not so already by the outlay and the excesses which it occasions 
In the associative state love of eating plays an entirely opposite role it is
    no longer a reward of idleness but of industry because there the poorest tiller of the
    soil participates in the consumption of choice commodities Moreover its only influence
    will be to preserve us from excess by dint of variety and to stimulate us to work by
    allying the intrigues of consumption to those of production preparation and
    distribution Production being the most important of the four let us first state the
    principle which must guide it it is the generalization of epicurism In point of fact 
If the whole human race could be raised to a high degree of gastronomic refinement
    even in regard to the most ordinary kinds of food such as cabbages and radishes and
    everyone be given a competence which would allow him to refuse all edibles which are
    mediocre in quality or treatment the result would be that every cultivated country would
    after a few years be covered with delicious productions for there would be no sale for
    mediocre ones such as bitter melons bitter peaches which certain kinds of soil yield
    upon which neither melons nor peaches would be cultivated every district would confine
    itself to productions which its soil is capable of raising to perfection it would fetch
    earth for spots where the soil is poor or perhaps convert them into forests artificial
    meadows or whatever else might yield products of good quality It is not that the
    passionate Series do not consume ordinary eatables and stuffs but they desire even in
    ordinary things such as beans and coarse cloth the most perfect quality possible in
    conformity to the proportions which Nature has established in industrial attraction 
The principle which must be our starting point is that a general perfection in
    industry will be attained by the universal demands and refinement of the consumers
    regarding food and clothing furniture and amusements
My theory confines itself to utilizing the passions now condemned just as Nature
    has given them to us and without in any way changing them That is the whole mystery
    the whole secret of the calculus of passionate Attraction There is no arguing there
    whether God was right or wrong in giving mankind these or those passions the associative
    order avails itself of them without changing them and as God has given them to us
Its mechanism produces coincidence in every respect between individual interest and
    collective interest in civilization always divergent 
It makes use of men as they are utilizing the discords arising from antipathies and
    other motives accounted vicious and vindicating the Creator from the reproach of a lacuna
    in providence in the matter of general unity and individual foresight 
Finally it in nowise disturbs the established order limiting itself to trial on a
    small scale which will incite to imitation by the double allurement of quadruple proceeds
    and attractive industry

There is no problem upon which people have gone more astray than upon public
    instruction and its methods Nature has in this branch of social politics taken a malign
    pleasure in all ages in confounding our theories and their exponents from the time of the
    disgrace incurred by Seneca the instructor of Nero to that of the failures of Condillac
    and Rousseau of whom the first fashioned only a political idiot and the second did not
    dare to undertake the education of his own children 
It will be observed that in Harmony the only paternal function of the father is to
    yield to his natural impulse to spoil the child to humor all his whims 
The child will be sufficiently reproved and rallied by his peers When an infant or
    little child has in the course of the day passed through half a dozen such groups and
    undergone their jokes he is thoroughly imbued with a sense of his insufficiency and
    quite disposed to listen to the advice of the patriarchs and venerables who are good
    enough to offer him instruction 
It will after that be of little consequence that the parents at the childs bed time
    indulge themselves in spoiling him telling him that he has been treated too severely
    that he is really very charming very clever these effusions will only skim the surface
    they will not convince The impression has been made He is humbled by the railleries of
    seven or eight groups of little ones which he has visited during the day In vain will it
    be for the father and mother to tell him that the children who have repulsed him are
    barbarians enemies of social intercourse of gentleness and kindliness all these
    parental platitudes will have no effect and the child on returning to the infantile
    seristeries the following day will remember only the affronts of the day before it is he
    who in reality will cure the father of the habit of spoiling by redoubling his efforts
    and proving that he is conscious of his inferiority
Nature endows every child with a great number of instincts in industry about thirty
    of which some are primary or guiding and lead to those that are secondary 
The point is to discover first of all the primary instincts the child will seize this
    bait as soon as it is presented to him accordingly as soon as he is able to walk to
    leave the infant seristery the male and female nurses in whose charge he is placed hasten
    to conduct him to all the workshops and fill the industrial reunions which are close by
    and as he finds every where diminutive tools an industry in miniature in which little
    tots of from two and a half to three years already engage with whom he is anxious to
    associate to rummage about to handle things at the end of a fortnight one may discern
    what are the workshops that attract him what his industrial instincts 
The phalanx containing an exceedingly great variety of occupations it is impossible
    that the child in passing from one to the other should not find opportunities of
    satisfying several of his dominant instincts these will exhibit themselves at the sight
    of the little tools manipulated by other children a few months older than himself 
According to civilized parents and teachers children are little idlers
    nothing is more erroneous children are already at two and three years of age very
    industrious but we must know the springs which Nature wishes to put in action to attract
    them to industry in the passionate series and not in civilization The dominant
    tastes in all children are 

1 Rummaging or inclination to handle everything examine everything look
    through everything to constantly change occupations 
    2 Industrial commotion taste for noisy occupations 
    3 Aping or imitative mania
    4 Industrial miniature a taste for miniature workshops 
    5 Progressive attraction of the weak toward the strong 
There are many others I limit myself to naming these five first which are very
    familiar to the civilized Let us examine the method to be followed in order to apply them
    to industry at an early age 
The male and female nurses will first exploit the mania for rummaging so dominant in a
    child of two He wants to peer into every place to handle and examine everything he sees
    He is consequently obliged to be kept apart in a bare room otherwise he would destroy
    everything 
This propensity to handle everything is a bait to industry to draw him to it he will
    be conducted to the little workshops there he will see children only two and a half and
    three years old using little tools little hammers He will wish to exercise his imitative
    mania termed APING he will be given some tools but he will want to be admitted among
    the children of twenty six and twenty seven months who know how to work and who will
    repel him 
He will persist if the work coincides with any of his instincts the nurse or the
    patriarch will teach him some portion of the work and he will very soon succeed in making
    himself useful in some trifling things which will serve him as an introduction let us
    examine this effect in regard to an inconsiderable kind of labor within the reach of the
    smallest children the shelling and sorting of green peas This work which with us would
    occupy the hands of people of thirty will be consigned to children of two three four
    years of age the hall is provided with inclined tables containing a number of hollows
    two little ones are seated at the raised side they take the peas out of the shell the
    inclination of the table causes the grains to roll towards the lower side where three tots
    are placed of twenty five thirty thirty five months charged with the task of sorting
    and furnished with special implements 
The thing to be done is to separate the smallest peas for the sweetened ragout the
    medium ones for the bacon ragout and the largest for the soup The child of thirty five
    months first selects the little ones which are the most difficult to pick out she sends
    all the large and medium ones to the next hollow where the child of thirty months shoves
    those that seem large to the third hollow returns the little ones to the first and drops
    the medium grains into the basket The infant of twenty five months placed at the third
    hollow has an easy task he returns some medium grains to the second and gathers the
    large ones into his basket 
It is in this third rank that the infant debutante will be placed he will
    mingle proudly with the others in throwing the large grains into the basket it is very
    trifling work but he will feel as if he had accomplished as much as his companions he
    will grow enthusiastic and be seized by a spirit of emulation and at the third seance
    he will be able to replace the infant of twenty five months to send back the grains of
    the second size into the second compartment and to gather up only the largest ones which
    are easily distinguished
If civilized education developed in every child its natural inclinations we should see
    nearly all rich children enamored of various very plebeian occupations such as that of
    the mason the carpenter the smith the saddler I have instanced Louis the XVI who
    loved the trade of locksmith an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker a certain
    king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes the former king of Naples
    loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market place himself the prince of Parma
    whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles in the understanding of intuition
    of cognition had no taste but for the occupation of church warden and lay brother 
The great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes if civilized
    education did not oppose the development of them and if the filthiness of the workshops
    and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the
    attraction What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four
    occupations I have just mentioned that of mason carpenter smith saddler and who would
    not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight
    workshops by refined people who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children
    with little implements and light labor
No attempt will be made as is the case in existing educational methods to create
    precocious little savants intellectual primary school beginners initiated from
    their sixth year in scientific subtleties the endeavor will by preference be to secure
    mechanical precocity capability in bodily industry which far from retarding the growth
    of the mind accelerates it 
If one wishes to observe the general inclination of children of from four and a half to
    nine years of age he will see that they are strongly drawn to all material exercises and
    very little to studies it is right then that in accordance with the desire of nature or
    attraction the cultivation of the material should predominate at that age 
Why this impulse of childhood toward material exercises Because Nature wishes above
    all to make man husbandman and manufacturer to lead him to wealth before leading him to
    science

The calculus of Harmony for which Madame A F seeks publicity is a discovery that the human race was far from expecting It is a mathematical theory concerning the destinies of all the globes and their inhabitants a theory of the sixteen social orders which can be established on the diverse globes throughout eternity
Of the sixteen possible societies only three are to be seen on our globe Savagery Barbarism and Civilisation Soon they will come to an end and all the nations of the earth will enter the fifteenth stage which is Simple Harmony
Great men of all the centuries Newton and Leibnitz Voltaire and Rousseau do you know in what you are great In blindness You will soon seem like no more than great madmen for having thought that civilisation was the social destiny of the human race How could you have failed to understand that these three societies the savage the barbarian and the civilised are but rungs to be climbed that they are reasons age of childhood and imbecility and that God would be improvident if he had conceived of nothing better adapted to human happiness These three societies are the most disastrous among the sixteen Of the sixteen there are seven which will see the establishment of perpetual peace universal unity the liberty of women
I owe this astonishing discovery to the analytic and synthetic calculus of passionate attraction which our savants have deemed unworthy of attention during their two thousand five hundred years of study They have discovered the laws of material movement thats all very well but it doesnt get rid of poverty It was necessary to discover the laws of social movement Their invention is going to lead the human race to opulence to sensual pleasures to the unity of the globe I repeat this theory will be geometrical and applied to the physical sciences It is not an arbitrary doctrine like the political and moral sciences which are going to meet a sad fate There is going to be a great disaster at the libraries
If ever war was deplorable it is at this moment Soon the victors will be on the same level as the vanquished What point is there in conquests when the entire globe will comprise but a single nation will be run by a single administration In spite of this unity there will be no equality in harmony
To the chief of France can be reserved the honour of extracting the human race from social chaos of being the founder of Harmony and the liberator of the globe The rewards which this honour entails will not be modest and they will be transmitted in perpetuity to the descendants of the founder
Some readers will cry out dream visionary Patience In a short time we will wake them from their own frightful dream the dream of civilisation Blind savants just look at your cities paved with beggars your citizens struggling against hunger your battlefields and all your social infamies Do you still believe that civilisation is the destiny of the human race Or was J J Rousseau right in saying of the civilised These are not men there is a disorder in things the cause of which we have not yet fathomed

Citizen High Judge
It is with respect to a trivial matter that I am going to bring you great news Allow me half a page concerning this trifle which is the occasion for the revelation of universal harmony
I have been informed that a few individuals have sent you their critical comments about my article on the Triumvirate of which I am enclosing a copy It seems to me that the police commissioner handles the matter perfectly well I have talked with him and I will follow his instructions
On a number of occasions I have sent political missives to the Directory or to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs I have always received complimentary letters in reply I presume that the article on the Triumvirate will likewise be appreciated in its essence even though it might be deficient in its style since it was written hastily Although the ideas which it contains run counter to current policies they are only all the more worthy of attention The situation is menacing Upon the outbreak of continental war one of the two German empires will be divided up and then the triumvirate will be a reality From the outset it will actually be no more than a duumvirate for Germany unprotected and caught between the two rivals will become a vassal of one or the other But the duumvirate will still be only a trap for France and when I warn my country that it is likely to be defeated in a subsequent conflict that Russia will have the means to strike some decisive blows and that France will have very few advantages in its favor I am asserting nothing that I could not prove in the greatest detail I dare to believe that this warning will win the approbation of the government rather than its disapproval and that the printer who published it out of confidence in me will be given no trouble2 
But this is not the matter which I propose to discuss with you These disputes of civilisation are no more than childs play in the present circumstances An event of much greater importance is brewing and I wish to make it known to the government
Universal Social Harmony and the Imminent Collapse of the Civilised Barbarian and Savage Societies
I am the inventor of the mathematical calculus of the destinies a calculus which Newton had within his grasp without realising it He determined the laws of material attraction and I have discovered those of passionate attraction a theory approached by no one before me
Passionate attraction is the archetype according to which God has regulated all the modifications of matter the order of universal movement and the social movement of the human inhabitants of all the worlds
As long as a globe fails to calculate the laws of attraction by analysis and synthesis its reason advances from shadow to shadow it cannot acquire the slightest notion of the laws which govern the universe of the social destinies the goal of the passions etc
The theory of the destinies can be divided into three principal branches
First The theory of the creations that is to say the determination of the plans adopted by God concerning the modifications of matter including everything from the cosmogony of the universes and the invisible stars to the most minute alterations of matter in the animal vegetable and mineral kingdoms The plans followed by God in the distribution of passions properties forms colours tastes etc to the diverse substances
Second The social movement that is to say the future and past destinies of human societies on the diverse globes their ordonnance their revolutions their characters etc
Third Immortality or the future and past destiny of God and of souls in the diverse worlds which they have traversed and will traverse throughout eternity
You see Citizen Minister that the complete elaboration of this prodigious theory would be much too difficult a task for one man or even for several Thus I have devoted myself primarily to the most urgent calculation that of the social movement and the societary destiny of the industrious nations I have determined the whole mechanism of Harmony in its smallest details from the methods of its central administration down to the most minute aspects of its domestic relations which are diametrically opposed to our own
As for calculations other than that of the social movement I have limited myself to finding the key to making trials in each of the fixed sciences3 and even in the fixed arts like music I will hand over that key to the savants it will be a prize which will provide them with ample means of winning fame I will keep for myself only the honour of having opened the way for them but I will have all to myself the honour of the discovery of the laws of universal harmony
It is obvious that if this discovery could not satisfy the passions of great men and sovereigns it would be useless and ridiculous to announce the imminence of Harmony if it offered them no more than three times the advantages of their present situation they would decide to remain in civilisation This is something which I had to anticipate But their pleasures in the new order will be so prodigious that they will become its most enthusiastic partisans for their souls and senses are more practiced than those of the vulgar more apt at appreciating and savouring states of happiness
The laws of Harmony should have been discovered 2300 years ago they have remained unknown due to the inadvertence and pride of the three metaphysical moral and political sciences These sciences have failed to determine the functions and duties of God They should have recognised that God owes men a social code To discover this code they should have opened an inquiry concerning the means of revelation employed by God to make his designs known to us Attraction which explains the designs of God with regard to the stars and the animals is also the organ of God with regard to human beings Its synthesis forms the code for the reign of social harmony which is going to last approximately sixty thousand years After that the cooling of the globe will bring a marked decline in luxury With the final disappearance of luxury which is the pivot of Harmony the human race will fall back into subversion Mankind will complete its course as it began by traversing the civilised barbarian and savage societies and others which belong to the subversive order4 
Since the announcement of this discovery will help bring about peace in the measure that it wins the confidence of the government I ought Citizen High Judge to explain it to you in a detailed memorandum But since my right hand is sprained and in bad condition for writing I cannot devote myself now to the composition of a lengthy essay The details of Harmony are so extraordinary that a superficial explanation would be quite inadequate If you wish I will go into a few details but given the state of my sprained hand I can scarcely promise more than two large sheets like this one
Being the sole possessor of the theory of social movement I shall not give it away to the public Instead I shall make known only the superficial aspects of the calculus taking precautions so that its essence and the solutions to the problems it raises may be safeguarded for the French government Thus the First Consul cannot be beaten out by any other prince in the establishment of Harmony He will be assured of no competition for the title of Primate or Emperor of the Globe a title to be conferred by right upon the founder There is no impertinence or charlatanism about this for the calculus is correct mathematical and invariable
Do not suppose Citizen High Judge that this discovery could become a rallying point for fanatics and intriguers On the contrary it offers a sure means of foiling the civil and political trouble makers of all countries For the whole earth is going to enjoy a better lot Poverty will be completely eliminated and a graduated metamorphosis will turn the poor class into a middle class will bring opulence to the bourgeois splendour to the opulent and so forth This perspective which is well substantiated and confirmed by all conceivable proofs will wither the seeds of civil or political discord and calm the most turbulent individuals
Permit me a few lines of argument Poverty is the principal cause of social disorders Inequality so much maligned by the philosophers is not displeasing to men On the contrary the bourgeois delights in hierarchy he loves to see the bigwigs decked out and parading in their best finery The poor man views them with the same enthusiasm Only if he lacks what is necessary does he begin to detest his superiors and the customs of society This is the origin of social disorders crimes and of the gallows that sad bastion of the civilised order It is easy to prove that all social crimes committed out of ambition proceed from the poverty of the people from their efforts to escape poverty from the anxiety which is instilled in society by the presence of poverty from the fear of falling into it and from disgust for the odious habits which it encourages
For social science there is thus only one problem to resolve that of the graduated metamorphosis which I have mentioned By this I mean the art of raising each of the classes of civilisation to the condition of the class above it Then indigence and discomfort will be eliminated since the lower class will have become the middle class and will enjoy an honest comfort like our petty bourgeois who are far removed indeed from a spirit of sedition5 When the people enjoy constant comfort and a decent minimum all the sources of discord will be dried up or reduced to very little Administration will become childs play and in Harmony the government of the whole planet will be much less complicated than that of a civilised empire
To eliminate poverty it was necessary to conceive of an industrial system more productive than our own Such will be universal harmony which will produce at least triple  yes without exaggeration  at least triple the yield of the civilised system in a well cultivated empire Accordingly while Harmony will greatly increase the wealth of the well to do it will bring about an excessive increase in that of the people to whom it will guarantee a salary or in old age a decent minimum below which they cannot fall This beneficence will be all the more simple in that humanity will reproduce much less in Harmony than in civilisation
This is far removed from the theories of the philosophers some of whom the Demagogues seek to rob the rich to provide for the poor6 The others who are called the Economists do not have the welfare of the people in mind7 They think only of enriching empires without worrying themselves about the fate of the individual Thus the theories of the Economists have greatly enriched England without enriching the English According to the Tableau de Londres8 you can find 115000 paupers prostitutes thieves beggars and unemployed in the city of London alone the workers of Scotland live in a frightful state of misery This is nonetheless the consequence of the modern systems which claim to alleviate the suffering of the people
Furthermore just as Steuart9 prophesied none of the philosophical theories has proved adequate to deal with the problem of excessive population The civilised reproduce too much produce too little and waste vast quantities of food labour time energy etc Count Rumford10 and Cadet de Vaux11 are the only writers I know who have understood the vice of civilised societies These societies are going to reduce the common people to the most frightful poverty everywhere except in new areas like the United States where labour is lacking The source of this widespread indigence is excessive procreation Nevertheless humanity will be able to multiply for about eighty more years in order to bring the globe to its full size of three billion inhabitants Once this number is reached however the population will remain fixed in Harmony What would be the point of having swarms of excess population once wars are abolished Excessive numbers of people will become so useless that France for its part will disgorge about five million of its inhabitants who will find homes in Spain the Ukraine etc
Let us summarise the problem which I have just raised it is to prove that three billion inhabitants in the order of Harmony will be just as productive as nine or ten billion in civilisation Of course this prodigious increase in wealth would be illusory if Harmony failed to eliminate the seeds of human discord such as war which neutralise the efforts of men and absorb the fruits of their industry no matter how great they may be
Note well that this prospect of future happiness does not rest solely upon an enormous increase in wealth For even a Lucullus would be most unhappy if his dominant passions were not satisfied The opulence of Harmony will merely be an agent of happiness merely a means for the development and gratification of a huge number of brilliant passions which are unknown in civilisation and will be revealed in Harmony For what is it to be happy if not to feel and gratify an immense number of harmless passions Such will be the lot of men when they are delivered from the civilised barbarian and savage states Their passions will be so numerous so explosive and so varied that the rich man will spend his life in a sort of permanent frenzy and the twenty four hours of his day will fly by like one
You can tell from this sketch Citizen High Judge that the announcement of this discovery will be a source of concord a balm poured on the wounds of the human race The certainty of such a brilliant metamorphosis will paralyse the ambitious and throw trouble makers into a state of apathy it will inspire a profound disdain for the tumult the torment the perfidies and the injustices of civilisation the widespread feeling to which it will give rise will be that of Charity Everyone will understand the necessity of working together to ease the lot of the poor until the establishment of Harmony will free them from want This charitable impulse will be the more spontaneous in that when the Spherical Hierarchy is constituted it will reimburse all the alms which have been provisionally voted
It is necessary Citizen High Judge to advise you of a comic incident which will follow the revelation of the theory of social movement It is going to deal a mortal blow to the political and moral philosophies and in addition an incurable wound to metaphysics These three sciences have engendered and sustained poverty perfidy and ignorance of the destinies  The disgrace of these three sciences will be a misfortune of very little importance As soldiers say You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs Thus in the encounter of truth and sophistry some sciences have got to crack Humanity will lose a great many books but it will win happiness affluence and peace for sixty thousand years Thats sufficient consolation 
You may be astonished that I have waited four years before publishing my discovery Here is the explanation for this delay At the time of the discovery I was a merchants clerk at Marseille I quit work to go to Paris to study the fixed sciences and apply them all to the calculus of passionate attraction I studied with ardour and in three or four years I would have applied all the sciences But after eight or nine months misfortunes befell me I had to break off my studies and resume my work as a merchants clerk at Lyon where I found a job Driven to despair by this bad turn of events I wished to safeguard my discovery until I regained the wealth necessary to continue my studies I was too proud to share the glory with the savants But since then I have undergone so much disgrace and illness that I renounce my plans for study I will no longer deprive the physicists and naturalists of the honour of embellishing the core of my theory with the demonstrative analogies which their sciences can provide once I give them the appropriate clues As a result of this delay the calculus will have undergone the trial advised by Horace novum prematur in annum12 It was quite unnecessary for passionate attraction is as invariable as physics If there are seven colours in the spectrum there are seven primitive passions in the soul If there are four arcs in a conic section there are four groups of passionate attraction and their properties are just the same as those of conic sections Nothing can vary in my theory
In order that this invention may provide me with a refuge from the poverty which pursues me I have decided to open a subscription It will be a success if the government grants me just one favour I simply need permission to publicise the invention in the Paris journals  Without your authorisation Citizen High Judge my subscription will fail the journals will not want to concern themselves with this discovery I dare hope for the protection of the government since it can be certain that I will not divulge any solutions and that the curious would vainly split their heads trying to solve the problems which I will leave unanswered If they dont know the secret their efforts will be in vain In any case there are not two people on the globe who have a flair for the problems of passionate attraction they are too overwhelming in their immensity and in their frightful simplicity
In unveiling before you the prospect of the welfare of all humanity perpetual peace the imminent cessation of poverty and crime and the elevation of the First Consul to a position of world supremacy I am sure Citizen High Judge to provoke not your doubts but your hopes concerning the veracity of the calculus If it had not been revealed earlier and if the First Consul were now acquainted with the laws of social movement he would be able to fool England completely by signing a peace treaty based on the expectation of the coming revolution This humiliation of a trouble making cabinet would be a brilliant jest with which to bring an end to civilisation
Among the social benefits which I have unveiled before you I should not forget to announce that two years after the establishment of Harmony we will see the end of all accidental ills venereal epidemics smallpox yellow fever etc As soon as the Spherical Hierarchy is constituted it will impose a quarantine on syphilitic diseases At the same time the Primate of the globe will recruit about twenty million pioneers to cleanse foul regions Thus the extinction of accidental maladies will take place within two or three years
Any brilliant discovery subjects its author to the attacks of the envious If Columbus Galileo and other great men could be excommunicated for being ahead of their time people may also try to blacken my reputation But we are no longer living in an age of superstition The conqueror of destiny fears nothing under the reign of the conqueror of success
I summarise Citizen High Judge the two requests which I have to make of you
1st the authorisation to have separate articles inserted in the Paris journals leaving them the latitude to make all necessary corrections according to the intentions of the censorship which I shall try to anticipate
2nd the communication of my letter or a copy to the First Consul I do not know how to get it directly to him and I am counting on your help in this matter He cannot fail to be moved at the idea of rescuing the human race from social chaos of banishing poverty and crime forever from the face of the earth and of becoming the terrestrial arm of God of directing mankind to its destiny He will not mistrust the man who offers him such a future Extremes touch if I am unknown and destitute I expect to inspire the confidence of the first of men by the very excess of my obscurity
I have the honour to offer you my respectful salutations

I was thinking of nothing less than of research concerning the Destinies I shared the widespread view which considers them to be impenetrable and which relegates any calculation about the destinies to a place among the visions of the astrologers and the magicians The studies which led me up to the discovery centred simply around the industrial and political problems that I am now going to discuss
After the philosophers had demonstrated their incapacity in their experimental venture in the French Revolution everyone agreed in regarding their science as an aberration of the human mind their floods of political and moral enlightenment seemed to be nothing more than floods of illusions Well what else can be found in the writings of these savants who after having perfected their theories for twenty five centuries after having accumulated all the wisdom of the ancients and moderns begin by engendering calamities as numerous as the benefits which they promised and help push civilised society back toward the state of barbarism Such was the consequence of the first five years during which the philosophical theories were inflicted on France
After the catastrophe of 1793 illusions were dissipated the political and moral sciences were irretrievably blighted and discredited From that point on people should have understood that there was no happiness to be found in acquired learning that social welfare had to be sought in some new science and that new paths had to be opened to political genius It was evident that neither the philosophers nor their rivals possessed a remedy for the social distresses and that their dogmas only served to perpetuate the most disgraceful calamities among others poverty
Such was the first consideration which led me to suspect the existence of a still unknown Social Science and which provoked me to try to discover it Far from taking fright at my lack of knowledge I thought only about the honour of laying hold of what the savants had been unable to discover for twenty five centuries
I was encouraged by numerous symptoms of the aberration of reason and particularly by the spectacle of the calamities afflicting social industry poverty unemployment the success of rascality acts of maritime piracy commercial monopoly the abduction of slaves finally other misfortunes too numerous to mention and which give one cause to ask whether civilised industry is not a calamity invented by God in order to punish the human race
All this led me to suppose that some reversal of the natural order had taken place within industry that it was perhaps functioning in a manner contrary to the designs of God that the tenacity of so many scourges could be attributed to the absence of some arrangement willed by God and unknown to our savants Finally I thought that if the human societies are suffering as Montesquieu put it from a lingering disease an inner vice a secret and hidden venom one might find the remedy by avoiding the paths followed for so many centuries and with such bad luck by our uncertain sciences13 Thus I adopted as my rules of research the principles of absolute doubt and absolute deviation These two methods must be defined since before me no one had ever made use of them
1st absolute doubt Descartes had an inkling but while praising and recommending doubt he used it in a limited and inappropriate way He raised ridiculous doubts he doubted his own existence and spent more time distilling the sophisms of the ancients than looking for useful truths
Descartes successors made even less use of doubt than he They applied the method only to things which displeased them for instance they raised questions about the necessity of religions because they were the antagonists of the priests But they were very careful not to raise questions about the necessity of the political and moral sciences which were their means of subsistence and which are today recognised as very useless under strong governments and as very dangerous under weak governments
Since I had no relations with any scientific party I resolved to apply the method of doubt to the opinions of all the parties without prejudice and to suspect even those dispositions which had won universal assent Such is civilisation which is the idol of all the philosophical parties and to which they attribute the ultimate of perfection However what is more imperfect than this civilisation which drags all calamities in its wake What is more questionable than its necessity and its future permanence Isnt it probable that it is only a stage in the life of society If it has been preceded by three other societies Savagery Patriarchate and Barbarism does it follow that it will be the last because it is the fourth Could not others still be born and wont we see a fifth a sixth a seventh social order which will perhaps be less disastrous than civilisation and which have remained unknown because we have never attempted to discover them Thus the method of Doubt must be applied to civilisation we must doubt its necessity its excellence and its permanence These are problems which the philosophers dont dare to face because in suspecting civilisation they would call attention to the nullity of their own theories which are all linked to civilisation and which will all collapse with it as soon as a better social order is found to replace it
Thus the philosophers have limited themselves to a Partial Doubt because they have books and corporate prejudices to uphold and fearing to compromise the books and the coterie they have always equivocated on the important questions But I who had no party to defend could adopt the method of Absolute Doubt and apply it first of all to civilisation and to its most deeply rooted prejudices
2nd absolute deviation I had presumed that the surest means of making useful discoveries was to deviate in every way from the paths followed by the uncertain sciences which had never made the slightest discovery useful to society and which in spite of the immense progress of industry had not even succeeded in warding off poverty Thus I made it my business to remain in constant opposition to these sciences Taking into consideration the multitude of their writers I presumed that any subject which they had treated ought to be completely exhausted and I resolved to apply myself only to problems which none of them had treated
Accordingly I avoided any inquiry into matters concerning the interests of the throne and altar about which the philosophers have busied themselves ceaselessly ever since the origin of their science They have always sought social welfare in administrative or religious innovations I applied myself on the contrary to seeking the good only in operations which would have nothing to do either with administration or with the priesthood which would rely only on industrial or domestic measures and which would be compatible with all governments without requiring their intervention
In following these two guides Absolute Doubt concerning all prejudices and Absolute Deviation from all known theories I was sure to discover some new field of speculation if any remained but I scarcely expected to grasp the calculus of the Destinies Far from aiming so high I devoted myself at first only to very ordinary problems such as Agricultural Association  When I began to speculate on this matter I would myself never have presumed that such a modest calculation could lead to the theory of the Destinies But since it has become the key to the theory it is indispensable for me to speak about it at some length 
More than once people have supposed that incalculable savings and ameliorations would result if one could bring together the inhabitants of a village in an industrial society if one could associate two or three hundred families of unequal wealth according to their capital and their work At first the idea seems completely impractical because of the obstacle that would be presented by the human passions The obstacle seems particularly great because the passions cannot be overcome by gradual degrees It is scarcely possible to create an agricultural association of twenty thirty forty or fifty individuals But at least eight hundred are necessary to establish a natural or attractive association I mean by these words a society whose members would be inspired to work by rivalry self esteem and other stimuli compatible with self interest In the order to which I refer we will become passionately enthusiastic about agricultural work which is so irksome today that we only do it out of necessity and the fear of dying of hunger
I will not discuss the stages of my research concerning the problem of natural association It is a system so foreign to our ways that I am in no hurry to describe it in detail It would seem ridiculous if I did not first provide the reader with a glimpse of the immense advantages which it will yield
An agricultural association of roughly a thousand people offers such immense advantages that it is difficult to explain the fact that our modern philosophers have shown no interest in the idea There is a group of savants the economists who are supposed to be particularly interested in industrial ameliorations Their failure to search for a method of association is all the more inconceivable in that they have themselves indicated several of the advantages which will result from association For instance they have recognised as anyone else could have done that three hundred families of associated villagers could have just a single well kept granary instead of three hundred run down granaries a single wine vat instead of three hundred poorly maintained vats In many cases and especially in summer these villagers could have just three or four large ovens instead of three hundred They could send a single dairymaid to town with a wagon bearing a cask of milk and thus save a hundred other dairymaids the time and trouble it takes to carry their pitchers into town These are just a few of the savings that diverse observers have recognised and yet they have not indicated one twentieth of the advantages which will result from agricultural association 
Disputatious people are sure to raise objections How can you form an association out of families when one may have 100000 livres and another may be penniless How can you reconcile so many conflicting interests and desires How can you absorb all their jealousies in such a way as to serve everyones interest My reply to all this is by the enticement of wealth and pleasure The strongest passion of both peasants and city people is the love of profit When they see that a societary community yields a profit three times that of a community of incoherent families and provides all its members with the most varied pleasures they will forget all their rivalries and hasten to form an association The system will be adopted everywhere without the application of any form of constraint for people everywhere are passionately devoted to wealth and pleasure
To summarise this theory of agricultural association which is going to change the condition of the human race appeals to the passions which are common to all men it seduces them with the enticements of profit and sensual pleasure That is why it is sure to succeed among the savages and barbarians as well as the civilised for the passions are the same everywhere
There is no urgency about making known this new system to which I will give the name progressive series or series of groups passionate series14 By these words I mean to designate an assemblage of several associated groups whose members are devoted to different branches of a single industry or a single passion  The theory of passionate series or progressive series has not been conceived arbitrarily like our social theories The ordonnance of these series is entirely analogous to that of a geometrical series Both have the same properties such as the balance of rivalry between the extreme groups and the intermediate groups of the series 
People have regarded the passions as enemies of concord and have written thousands of volumes against them These volumes are going to fall into nothingness For the passions tend only to concord to that social unity which we have thought was so alien to them But the passions can only be harmonised if they are allowed to develop in an orderly fashion within the progressive series or series of groups Outside of this mechanism the passions are only unchained tigers incomprehensible enigmas For this reason the philosophers have claimed that they must be repressed Their opinion is doubly absurd since the passions cannot be repressed and since if they could civilisation would rapidly disappear and man would rapidly fall back into a nomadic state in which the passions would be even more harmful than they are now I have no more faith in the virtues of the shepherds than in those of their apologists
The societary order which is going to replace the incoherence of civilisation has no place for moderation or equality or any of the other philosophical notions It requires ardent and refined passions As soon as an association is formed the passions will harmonise with greater ease if they are more intense and more numerous
This is not to say that the new order will change the passions Neither God nor man is capable of changing them but it is possible to change their direction without changing their nature  Thus if I maintain that in the societary order men will acquire tastes which are different from those which they have at present that they will prefer to live in the country rather than the city one should not believe that in acquiring new tastes they will acquire new passions They will still be guided by the love of wealth and pleasure
I insist on this point to meet an objection which has been raised by certain obtuse individuals When they hear me talk about the new tastes and customs which will emerge in the societary order they immediately exclaim So you want to change the passions Certainly not But what I do want to do is to provide them with new means of expression to assure them three or four times the development which they have in the incoherent order in which we live This is why we will see civilised people acquire an aversion for habits which please them today such as family life In the family system children spend all their time crying quarrelling breaking things and refusing to work But when these same children have joined the progressive series or series of groups they will become industrious they will try to emulate each others accomplishments without any outside encouragement they will enthusiastically try to inform themselves about agriculture manufacturing science and art they will perform useful tasks while they think they are amusing themselves When fathers witness this new order o f things they will find their children adorable in the series and detestable in the incoherent household Then they will observe that in the residence of a phalanx  this is the name I give to the association which farms a rural area people are served marvellous food  Finally they will discover that in the activities and relations of the series there is never any cheating and that people who are so dishonest and crude in civilisation will become paragons of honesty and refinement in the series When they have seen all this they will acquire an aversion for the household the cities and the civilisation of which they are now so fond They will want to associate themselves in the series of a Phalanx and live in its edifice Will they have changed their passions in becoming disdainful of the customs and tastes which please them today No their passions will have changed their means of expression without having changed their nature or their ultimate goal
Thus one should beware of supposing that the system of the progressive series which will be entirely different from that of civilisation will bring about the slightest change in the passions The passions have been and will remain immutable They will produce conflict and poverty outside of the progressive series and harmony and opulence in the societary state which is our destiny The establishment of the societary order in a single community will be spontaneously imitated everywhere thanks to the immense profits and innumerable pleasures which that order will assure to all individuals however poor or wealthy they may be
I shall turn now to the results of this discovery from a scientific standpoint  As to the new sciences which it has revealed I shall confine myself to indicating the two most important ones Since these matters will not interest most of my readers I shall try to be as brief as possible
The first science which I discovered was the theory of passionate attraction When I recognised that the progressive series assure full development to the passions of both men and women of the young and the old and of people in every social class when I discovered that in this new order a great number of passions will be a guarantee of strength and wealth I surmised that if God had given so much influence to passionate attraction and so little to its enemy reason His purpose was to guide us to the system of progressive series which is completely consistent with attraction Then I supposed that attraction which is so much maligned by the philosophers must be the interpreter of the designs of God concerning the social order By this means I arrived at the analytic and synthetic calculus of passionate attractions and repulsions This calculus cannot fail to culminate in agricultural association Thus if anyone had attempted to study attraction analytically and synthetically he would have discovered the laws of association without seeking them This is something that no one has ever dreamed of Even in the eighteenth century when analytical methods were so popular no one ever tried to apply them to attraction
The theory of passionate attractions and repulsions is an exact science and wholly applicable to geometrical theorems It has great ramifications and can become the sustenance of the philosophers who are I believe very much in need of some luminous and useful problem on which to exercise their metaphysical talents
I continue my discussion of the filiation of the new sciences I soon recognised that the laws of passionate attraction were in complete accord with the laws of material attraction as explained by Newton and Leibnitz and that there was a unified system of movement governing the material world and the spiritual world
I suspected that this analogy might apply to particular laws as well as to general ones and that the attractions and properties of the animals vegetables and minerals were perhaps coordinated with the same scheme as those of man and the stars After making the necessary investigations I became convinced of this Thus a new exact science was discovered the analogy of the material organic animal and social movements or the analogy of the modifications of matter with the mathematical theory of the passions of man and the animals15
The discovery of these two exact sciences revealed others to me It would be useless to list them all here But they include everything up to literature and the arts and they will permit the establishment of exact methods in all the domains of human knowledge
Once I had discovered the two theories of attraction and the unity of the four movements I began to make sense of the book of nature One by one I found the answers to its mysteries I had lifted the veil that was supposed to be impenetrable I advanced into a new scientific world It was thus that I arrived by gradual degrees at the calculus of the Universal Destinies or the determination of the fundamental system governing all the laws of movement present past and future

To unveil the intrigues of the stock exchange and the brokers is to undertake a Herculean task I doubt that the demi god felt as much disgust in cleaning the Augean stables as I feel in probing the sink of moral filth which is called the bordel of exchange and brokerage This is a subject that science has not even touched upon To discuss it you need a practitioner grown grey in the service and raised in the mercantile pen as I have been since the age of six At that age I began to notice the contrast which exists between commerce and truth I was taught at catechism and at school that one must never lie then they took me to the store to accustom me to the noble trade of deceit or the art of selling Shocked by the cheating and deception which I witnessed I began to take the merchants aside and tell them what was being done to them One of them in his complaint made the mistake of betraying me and this earned me a hard spanking My parents who saw that I was addicted to the truth exclaimed reproachfully This child will never do well in commerce In fact I conceived a secret aversion for commerce and at the age of seven I swore an oath like that which Hannibal swore against Rome at the age of nine I swore myself to an eternal hatred of commerce
They got me into commerce against my will I was lured to Lyon by the prospect of a trip but at the very door of Scherers banking house where they were taking me I deserted announcing that I would never be a merchant It was like backing out of a marriage on the altar steps They took me to Rouen where I quit a second time In the end I bent to the yoke and I lost the best years of my life in the workshops of deceit Everywhere I went I heard echoes of the sinister prophecy What a fine honest lad He will never do well in commerce In fact I have been duped and robbed in all my undertakings But if I have no talent for the practice of commerce I am quite able to unmask it

Well Why have nations taken so long to realise that the commercial order is a temporary monstrosity an utterly senseless system that places the three productive classes  proprietors farmers and manufacturers  at the mercy of a parasitical class which has no national loyalty and which can do whatever it wishes with the fruits of industry over which it exercises arbitrary control So faulty a system is obviously the result of a failure in social science Commerce could have seemed tolerable in the childhood of human societies although even then it was scorned But it is unworthy of the modern age which aspires to enlightenment and perfectibility and which boasts of seeking the truth  of which commerce is the mortal enemy Let us then investigate why the invention of a better system has been put off until our own time and why no effort has been made to discover some means of liberating society from the influence of commerce and deceit16 
I have already said that the wise men of antiquity never made commerce an object of study they simply treated it with the scorn which it deserves The masters of the world the Alexanders and the Caesars would have smiled with pity if someone had advised them to subordinate their policies in todays fashion to the interests of dealers in oil and soap The privileges that commerce had enjoyed at Carthage17 were alone sufficient to debase it in the eyes of Rome thus the Roman writers relegated it to a place among the filthy professions
As for the small republics of Tyr Carthage and Athens which were devoted to traffic they never influenced opinion in the great empires They vaunted their trade for the same reason that brigandage was vaunted by the Tatars and piracy by the Algerians They fleeced their neighbours as often as possible and they were regarded as birds of prey whose voracity is abhorred but who are tolerated because they are not entirely useless 
The role of commerce in antiquity amounted to very little Just what was the vaunted trade of Tyr Carthage and Athens I would say that the activity of these three ports was barely equal to that of three of our small ports like Nice Bayonne and Dieppe in peacetime At that time there was little to exchange among the states on the shores of the Mediterranean Since the goods which they produced were just about the same farming and industry provided few occasions for trade The backwardness of navigation prevented them from finding markets for their goods in the torrid and cold zones  It is clear that the commerce of antiquity must have been quite insubstantial when we consider that its most important branch the grain trade was frequently controlled by rulers We read that Hiero the King of Syracuse made shipments of wheat to the Roman Senate Thus in the nations of antiquity commerce was only a shadow  no more than a tenth  of what it is today For this reason it is not surprising that the statesmen of that time paid little attention to their merchants and scorned their wiles without trying to reform them just as the gross customs of the lower classes are disdained but tolerated today Antiquity neither could nor would devote itself to the search for another mode of exchange it simply tolerated commerce as a vulgar vice
Circumstances are very different today Various unforeseen events have produced a colossal growth in commerce Progress in the art of navigation the discovery of the East and West Indies with all their resources the extension of farming to northern latitudes the establishment of communications between the three zones the rapid development of manufacturing and the competition for trade among a multitude of nations  all these factors have led to a prodigious increase in the volume of commerce It can be said to have increased ten fold since Antiquity Trade has now become one of the principal branches of the social mechanism it has finally drawn the attention of the philosophers they have ceased to ridicule it Among them one group of men who are called the Economists has devoted itself to the study of industrial policy 
When political economy emerged as a science commerce was already powerful and revered The Dutch had already accumulated their hoards of gold they had discovered the means to bribe and corrupt kings and their courts long before anyone had heard of the Economists At the outset then commerce was a giant and political economy was only a dwarf When political economy entered the lists against commerce the ports were already swarming with wealthy ship fitters and the great cities were full of those dandified bankers who are intimate with ministers and give orders to diplomats It was no longer possible as in antiquity to treat commerce as a laughing stock for there is no greater title to respect in civilisation than a bulging safe The first efforts of political economy were all the more modest in that its authors possessed neither wealth nor an established body of doctrine Since the legacy of antiquity amounted to no more than a few jeers about commerce they had to create everything for themselves Deprived of the wisdom of antiquity and thrown back on their own resources the poor Economists were obliged to adopt modest and timid dogmas This was only becoming in a few unknown savants who had to enter the scientific world by doing combat with the Croesus of the age
There could be no doubt about the outcome of such a combat Political economy made only a faint gesture of resistance Praise for that gesture is due to Quesnay the leader of the French sect18 Trying to make the truth known he propagated dogmas which tended to subordinate commerce to the interests of agriculture But the English cabal which had sold out to commerce triumphed with the help of a few religious intrigues Philosophy which had opened hostilities against the priesthood was in need of reinforcements it prudently decided to ally itself with the money bags and to flatter commerce which was beginning to acquire a great influence Thus the Economists hitched themselves to the wagon of commerce They proclaimed it infallible like the ancient popes They declared that a merchants dealings could never fail to promote the public interest and that the merchant ought therefore to enjoy an absolute liberty All the dogmas were adapted to this paradox
Soon merchants were being showered with adulation Raynal Voltaire and all the most eminent philosophers could be seen kneeling before the golden calf But they secretly scorned it for when Voltaire dedicated his play Zaire to a London merchant whom he overwhelmed with banal compliments he was no more sincere than when he dedicated his Mahomet to Pope Benedict Voltaire was himself a consummate practitioner of mercantile trickery he excelled at duping book sellers Thus he knew the true worth of the fine art of trade he knew that merchants detest learning that they scorn the sciences and the arts that they are bored even by the flattery of writers when it does not serve to fine their pockets But the philosophical party was in need of new recruits and so they praised the merchants to the skies 
It must be said in defence of the philosophers that during the eighteenth century commerce was not as perverse as it is today There were relatively few merchants then and they made their profits easily Thus they did not need to resort to the innumerable subtleties and audacious tricks that degrade their profession today This is so true that elderly merchants are constantly voicing their stupefaction at todays wiles They are agreed in describing modern commerce as a snare a Black Forest by comparison with the friendly spirit in which trade was carried on before the Revolution We should add that at that time the English monopoly was not yet dominant France was still standing up to England and along with its allies it had a very substantial monopoly of its own That is why the French philosophers were not alarmed by an abuse from which their own nation benefited Everything conspired to make this mismatch seem attractive to philosophy In associating itself with commerce philosophy behaved just like a young noblewoman who marries a commoner whom she supposes to be an honest man And in fact it was impossible at that time to predict the immensity of vices and scourges that commerce was going to inflict upon the nineteenth century
But now the mercantile spirit has shown its profound malevolence The mask has fallen monopoly and deceit are now revealed Philosophy can no longer deceive itself about the infamies of the serpent with which it has been associated It is time for philosophy to break with commerce and return to the path of Truth which is wholly alien to the mercantile spirit A discovery is about to banish commerce from the womb of civilisation If it was pardonable to encourage commerce when there was some doubt about its perversity it would be odious to do so today now that Truth has unmasked it and cast it into disgrace

Within the last half century the capriciousness of fashion has given commerce a major influence on civilised politics The politicians would have been a good deal wiser if they had given their support to the manufacturing industries and not to commerce brokerage and speculation which are the natural enemies of manufacturing and of all productive industries
I will demonstrate later that commerce which is mistakenly classified among the productive forms of work ought to be ranked first among the parasitical professions like those of monk soldier lawyer etc The reduction of all these professions should be the constant aim of any sound political system
By its growth and influence the merchant class has done much more harm to industry than have the monks and lawyers
For the monks merely deprive the farms and workshops of their labour The lawyers fault is somewhat graver since they distract others from labour and rob them without producing anything themselves But commerce is guilty of both these vices and it adds a third it diverts and turns against industry capital which under a better system should be devoted uniquely to the improvement of farming and manufacturing
The commercial systems are for the moment Europes most fashionable chimera Authors who wish immediate renown write a brochure on credit exchange duties and paper money Tell us in your learned investigations why cottons have weakened and sugars are wavering Say why one empire has exported more ells of cloth than its neighbor If you explain these great mysteries to us in pounds sous and deniers the temple of fame is open to you Dont forget to dedicate your work to one of the saints of the day one of those bankers whose name makes all knees bend even at the court Dont go after the protection of official dignitaries senators and generals are and should be only in the second rank since they know nothing about commerce or banking Even kings will soon be proud to bear the title of merchants as they once boasted of being Fathers of the people and to maintain their popularity they will have to appear in public with a bale of cotton for a throne a measuring rod for a sceptre and with a coat of arms consisting of a few rolls of tobacco emblazoned against a background of bars of soap Ah dont the monarchs owe thanksgiving to commerce It was a trade rivalry between France and England that toppled their thrones it was a competition for sugar and coffee that sent Louis his family and the elite of France to the scaffold Has politics ever had such a bad effect on industry as it has in recent times Was there ever so much bad faith among tradesmen so much encouragement to speculation and bankruptcy as there has been since the court and the academies were infected by the mercantile spirit

Despite all its vices commerce is regarded as a perfect method of exchange because the contracting parties are free to come to terms or to decline to do so This freedom is only a negative benefit It has no value except by comparison with the methods of the barbarians with requisitions maximums tariffs etc It is far from sufficient in itself to secure equity fidelity confidence or economy in exchanges These and other benefits have no place in the commercial order which establishes all the opposite vices Commerce allows deceit and plunder to triumph it creates a climate of mistrust which impedes the development of economic relations and necessitates expensive precautions Finally it hinders and complicates the whole process of exchange

Commerce which is vaguely defined as free exchange is merely one method of free exchange and not the best To define it more precisely commerce is a mode of exchange in which the seller has the right to defraud with impunity and to determine by himself without arbitration the profit which he ought to receive The result is that the seller is the judge of his own case while the buyer is deprived of protection against the rapacity and cheating of the seller It makes no sense to say Good faith ought to reign in commerce One should say Good faith ought to reign in order to destroy commerce

The fundamental principle of the commercial systems is Let the merchants have complete freedom This principle concedes to them absolute ownership of the commodities in which they deal They have the right to take their goods out of circulation to hide them and even to burn them as was done more than once by the Dutch East India Company which publicly burned supplies of cinnamon in order to raise its price What it did with cinnamon it would have done with wheat had it not feared the anger of the common people it would have burned a part of its wheat or allowed it to rot in order to sell the rest at four times its value Well Every day on the docks can you not see people throwing into the sea supplies of grain that a merchant has allowed to rot while waiting for a rise in prices I have myself presided as a clerk over these foul operations and one day I jettisoned twenty thousand quintals of rice which could have been sold before it rotted for a fair profit had the owner been less greedy for gain It is society as a whole which suffers by such waste which you can see taking place every day under the cover of the philosophical principle Laissez faire les marchands19
Let us suppose that in a famine year like 1709 a rich company of merchants observes this principle by cornering all the grain in a small state such as Ireland Let us further suppose that the general scarcity and the restrictions on exports in neighbouring states have made it impossible to find grain abroad Having cornered all the available grain the company refuses to sell it until the price has tripled or quadrupled saying This grain is our property it pleases us to sell it at four times its cost If these terms dont suit you find your grain somewhere else While we are waiting for the price to rise a quarter of the population may die of starvation but that doesnt bother us We are sticking to our speculation in keeping with the principles of commercial liberty as consecrated by modern philosophy
I ask in what respect the actions of this company differ from those of a band of thieves for its monopoly compels the whole nation to pay a ransom equal to three times the value of the grain  or else die of starvation
According to the rules of commercial liberty the company has the right to refuse to sell at any price to allow the wheat to rot in its granaries while the people are starving Can you believe that the starving nation is in conscience bound to die of hunger for the honour of the fine philosophical principle Laissez faire les marchands Of course not Then admit that the right of commercial liberty should be subject to restrictions consistent with the needs of society as a whole Admit that a person who possesses a superabundance of a commodity which he has not produced and which he will not consume ought to be regarded as a conditional trustee of that commodity and not as its absolute owner Admit that the dealings of merchants and middlemen should be subordinated to the welfare of the mass of society and that these individuals should not be free to impede economic relations by all those disastrous manoeuvres which your economists admire
Are merchants alone exempt from the social obligations imposed on all the other classes of society When a general a judge or a doctor is given a free hand he is not authorised to betray the army despoil the innocent or assassinate his patient Such people are punished when they betray their trust the perfidious general is beheaded the judge must answer to the Minister of justice The merchants alone are inviolable and sure of impunity Political economy wishes no one to have the right of controlling their machinations If they starve a whole region if they disturb its industry with their speculation hoarding and bankruptcies everything is justified by the simple title of merchant This is like the quack doctor in the play who having killed everyone with his pills is justified because he can say in Latin medicus sum In our century of regeneration people are trying to convince us that the plots hatched by one of the least enlightened classes of society can never do harm to the welfare of the state Once upon a time people talked about the infallibility of the pope today it is that of the merchant which they wish to establish

What are the vices inherent in the commercial mechanism Others have defined it in flattering terms I am going to adopt a very different tone and show commerce to be the source of all sorts of crimes and misdeeds I will refer to just seven
The first disorder is Bankruptcy which scoffs at the efforts of legislators and triumphs in spite of all their legal codes20 Just recently French legislation was put to shame when it purported to repress bankruptcy with a new code of commerce Bankruptcy has only become bolder and more confident in changing its form and the new code is merely a weapon with which the bankrupt threaten the creditors whom they wish to rob
The second vice is Smuggling by which commerce rebels openly against authority and forms industrial Vendees against which the state must maintain parasitical armies of customs officers Certain cities like Basel and other such centres of contraband exploit neighbouring empires in the same way that the Algerian pirates exploit seafarers The ones are sea robbers and the others are land robbers I shall prove in one of the chapters of this work that by means of its contraband the city of Basel alone exacts an annual tribute of several million from France You can draw your own conclusions about the extent of the smuggling carried on each year over the whole territory of France Germany Spain and Italy
What shall I say of the Usurers who under the name of bankers are waging war against property owners Take for example the hordes of Jews and vagabonds who have practically overrun the four departments on the right bank of the Rhine They would soon have gobbled up most of the French property there if the government had not restrained them by decrees and by means of an economic struggle that involved the Bank of France which is an agent of resistance against usury
Speculation is the fourth of the plagues to which I am calling attention it is another one of the weapons used by commerce against governments Speculation abuses public confidence and makes sport of the ascendency of the noblest heroes Witness the campaign of Austerlitz during which a horde of Parisian speculators ravaged French industry discredited the Bank of France and the government bonds and created all the symptoms of a panic at the very moment when the Empire was echoing with cries of admiration and blind confidence in its illustrious chief
Hoarding is not the least of the mercantile feats It creates famine in the midst of abundance by means of contrived panics it can double the price of goods and exploit society in the interest of the commercial vampires
Parasitism is a less obvious but not less harmful disorder Hosts of merchants encumber the cities and the streets are cluttered with solicitors who swarm without limit or purpose There was competition enough when their number was only a quarter of what it is today and then agriculture profited from the capital and labour of the crowd of parasites with which commerce is now inundating the cities
Of all the commercial vices Cheating is the one which is making the most rapid progress Today it has reached such a point that merchants of the old type are thought to be incompetent because they dont know the tricks to which abusive competition has given rise

A Sentimental Bankruptcy

Each of the generic features of commerce such as speculation bankruptcy etc includes a vast array of species and varieties which should have been analyzed and classified  In discussing the hierarchy of bankruptcy I have made up a list comprising 3 orders 9 generic types and 36 species of bankruptcy21 This list could easily be tripled or quadrupled For bankruptcy has become such an art that every day someone invents a new species especially in the realm of governmental bankruptcies where France has just made an innovation the doubledupe or ampbidupe which has provided the nation with a new means of despoiling itself
Our century obliges people to adopt a facetious tone in criticising vice castigat ridendo22 We are supposed to avoid the grim tone of the moralists of the last century This would have been easy for me since in my hierarchy of bankruptcy I have described each of the 9 types and 36 species in amusing terms Take for example the fifth type the tactical bankruptcy This includes 5 species 17 the bankruptcy by squadrons 18 the firing line bankruptcy 19 the close column bankruptcy 20 the wide formation bankruptcy 21 the sharp shooters bankruptcy These five species comprise one of the types in the center of the series They correspond exactly to military manoeuvres Thus I have called this type the tactical and the one that precedes it the manoeuvring bankruptcy
It would be very easy then to satisfy the oratorical insistence on amusing criticism  castigat ridendo  while providing a frank and truthful analysis of the vice I could according to the method of the journalists present a list of the species of bankruptcy to make the reader desire a chapter on each one of them Everyone would be interested to see how I define such species as these
Sentimental infantile well to do cosmopolitan Gallant sanctimonious unprincipled amicable Stylish preferential wide netted miniature Break neck stealthy Attila like invalids Swindlers jail birds ninnys visionary Posthumous familial re decked push pin
An analysis of all these species of bankruptcy would produce many amusing chapters particularly since I am a child of the profession born and raised in the mercantile shops I have seen the infamies of commerce with my own eyes and I will not describe them from hear say as do our moralists who know nothing more about commerce than what they hear in the salons of the speculators and who know only the respectable side of bankruptcy proceedings According to them any bankruptcy  especially that of a broker or banker becomes a sentimental incident in which the creditors themselves are beholden to the bankrupt party for having palmed off his noble speculations on them The notary brings them the news as if it were an accident of fate an unforeseen catastrophe caused by the misfortunes of the times critical circumstances a deplorable turn of events etc This is the way one usually begins a letter announcing a bankruptcy
According to the notary and his accomplices who secretly derive ample remuneration from the loss these bankrupt individuals are so honourable so worthy of esteem A tender mother who is sacrificing herself for her children a virtuous father who is teaching them to love their constitution23 a tearful family which is worthy of a better fate and inspired by the most sincere love for every one of its creditors Truly it would be a crime not to aid this family to recover it is the duty of every honest man to help them
At this point a few moral shysters appear on the scene their palms well greased to talk of lofty sentiments and the pity which misfortune must inspire They are helped out by pretty female petitioners who are very useful in calming down the more recalcitrant creditors Shaken by all these intrigues three quarters of the creditors arrive at the judgment session unsettled and disoriented In advising the creditors to take a loss of 70% the notary depicts the 30% rebate as the effort of a virtuous family which is impoverishing itself and making every sacrifice to satisfy the sacred duties imposed by a sense of honour The creditors are told that in all conscience they ought to accept a loss of 80% in order to pay homage to the noble qualities of a family so worthy of esteem and so zealous in defence of the interests of its creditors
A few barbarians may wish to object to such terms But the accomplices who are spread about the room whisper that these recalcitrant individuals are immoral people that one of them does not go to church regularly that another keeps a mistress that another is known to be a Harpagon a usurer that still another has already gone bankrupt himself and is a hard hearted man with no indulgence for his fellows Finally most of the creditors give up and sign the contract whereupon the notary declares that it is a highly advantageous settlement for the creditors in that it has saved them the expense of legal fees and provided them with the opportunity to do a good turn to a virtuous family Everyone  or at least all of the fools who comprise the majority leaves filled with admiration for the virtue and the lofty sentiments of which this worthy family is the model
Thus concludes a sentimental bankruptcy in which the creditors are looted for at least two thirds of their money For a bankruptcy would only be honest and not sentimental if the settlement was fixed at 50% Indeed 50% is so normal a rate that the bankrupt party has no need of utilising artistic refinements if he is willing to settle at this modest rate Unless he is an imbecile he is sure to make at least a 50% profit on his bankruptcy
If someone had published a work describing a hundred species of bankruptcy with more details than I have given here on the sentimental bankruptcy this book would have made known one of the pretty traits of commerce one of its true features Other works dealing with other features such as speculation and hoarding would have opened peoples eyes and raised doubts about the commercial mechanism known as free competition which is the most anarchic and perverse mode of exchange that can exist

Accusation of the Uncertain Sciences

Celebrated philosophers have long recognised the existence of a great unfathomed mystery they have understood that man had failed in the study of nature and missed the paths which would have led to individual and collective happiness In ages less vain than ours savants have deplored this failure and looked forward to a time when the human race would arrive at a happier destiny than that of civilisation We find such prognostications in the writings of the most renowned authors from Socrates who prophesied that some day the light would descend to Voltaire who impatient to see it descend exclaimed How dark a night still veils all natures face24 
Plato and the Greek sophists expressed the same misgivings in other terms Their utopias were an indirect accusation of the social thought of their age which could not conceive of anything beyond the systems of civilisation and barbarism These writers are regarded as oracles of wisdom and yet from Socrates to Montaigne we find the most eminent of them deploring the insufficiency of their ideas and asking What do I know Today people talk in a different tone and Voltaire was right to complain that the cry of the modern sophists is What dont I know
All the honourable philosophers those who have not engaged in idle controversy have recognised the falseness of our social theories Montesquieu thinks that the social world is suffering from a chronic sickness an inner vice a secret and hidden venom J J Rousseau in speaking of the people of civilisation says These are not men there is a disorder in things the cause of which we have not yet fathomed
There are nonetheless people who vaunt the progress of our political sciences and the perfection of reason This is an in decent boast and it has been cruelly refuted by the general misfortune by the disastrous consequences of the so called enlightened theories which gave birth to the storms of revolution Was there ever a time like the present to stigmatise the regenerating sciences en masse They have already been condemned by their own authors Before the Revolution the compiler Barthelemy said  in his Voyage dAnacharsis These libraries the so called treasure houses of sublime knowledge are no more than a humiliating repository of contradictions and errors their abundance of ideas is in fact a penury What would he have said a few years later if he had seen the philosophical dogmas put to the test No doubt like Raynal he would have made a public confession of ignorance and said with Bacon We must revise our whole understanding of things and forget all that we have learned
A scholar could gather pages of such citations in which modern philosophy denounces its own wisdom I am merely citing a few imposing authorities who have preceded me in drawing attention to the spurious quality of our present enlightenment I wish only to make it clear that the greatest geniuses have prophesied and called for the discovery of a social theory other than the Philosophy which they blame for having misled human reason
What is the error committed by the philosophers What branch of learning have they failed to investigate There are several and notably the branch with which they claim to have been particularly concerned I mean the study of Man Although they claim to have exhausted the subject they know absolutely nothing about it They have concerned themselves with superficial problems like that of Ideology25 which are meaningless so long as we remain ignorant of the fundamental science which deals with mans basic impulses It is impossible to understand the nature of these impulses and their goal without a knowledge of the analytic and synthetic calculus of passionate attraction 
So long as the human mind has not discovered the calculus of the social destinies interpreted by the synthesis of attraction we must remain in a state of political cretinism Our progress in a few of the natural sciences  in mathematics physics chemistry etc  is useless for it has not provided us with a remedy for any of mans ills The accomplishments of these sciences only serve to emphasise the confusion of social thought which has done nothing to promote human happiness and which after thirty centuries of correctives and reforms has left all social evils as deeply rooted as ever 
What have we learned about man and his social destinies There are four sciences which claim to solve the riddle One of them called Ideology is only concerned with the surface of the question It has lost itself in quibbles and subtleties concerning the analysis of ideas and failed to study the real question which is that of the functions and uses of the passions and the laws of passionate attraction 
Three other sciences  politics moral philosophy and political economy  also claim to explain the problem of our destinies Let us analyse these sciences
Politics and political economy advocate theories which run counter to human destiny They encourage us to submit passively to civilisation with its system of incoherent and loathsome work when we should be trying to attain our true destiny which is societary work
A fourth philosophical science moral philosophy which also boasts of making man its study does just the opposite The only art that the moralists know is that of perverting human nature and repressing the souls impulses or passionate attractions on the grounds that they are not suited to the civilised and barbarian order The real problem on the contrary is to discover the means of escaping the civilised and barbarian order This order is in conflict with mans passions and inclinations all of which tend to unity to domestic and agricultural association
These four uncertain sciences vaunt the system of incoherent and piece meal work in order to dispense themselves of the task of inventing the societary system Having failed to perform their appointed task and having misled us for three thousand years they will come to the same end as all the anarchists who delude men with their promises of happiness and finally destroy one another
Such is the status of the philosophical sciences today like the revolutionary parties they are destroying one another before our very eyes One of the most reputable of these sciences Moral Philosophy has recently been overwhelmed by a party of new savants called the Economists The Economists have won favor by encouraging the love of wealth whereas morality advised men to throw their wealth into the womb of the avid seas By hoisting the banner of wealth and luxury and thus yielding to the first dictate of attraction the Economists were sure of crushing the moralists For the moralists wish us to scorn wealth only because they lack the means to obtain it for us like the fox in the fable they call the grapes too green because they are unable to reach them
What has civilisation gained by changing its banner by forsaking the moralists in order to follow the Economists It is true that the economists permit us to love wealth but they dont make us wealthy On the contrary the influence of their dogmas has only served to double the weight of taxes and the size of armies to promote poverty deceit and all the scourges Its material consequence has been the devastation of forests in the political sphere its fruit has been monopoly both naval and corporate Is there any vice which has not been aggravated by the intrusion of these dangerous doctors 
If we consider that the present state of generalised deprivation is the fruit of a hundred thousand social systems can we believe in the good faith of those who have amassed this clutter of dogmas Should we not divide the authors of these systems into two categories one composed of charlatans and the other of dupes For we must consider as dupes those who have believed that civilisation was mans destiny and have sought to perfect it instead of looking for a way out of it
Let us then distinguish those who in agreement with the Montesquieus the Rousseaus and the Voltaires have been suspicious of philosophy and civilisation We will give the name of Expectant Sophists to all those writers who since Socrates have sought the enlightenment which they admitted was not to be found in their own learning and under the term Obscurantist Sophists we will designate all those quacks who vaunt their nostrums of perfectibility although well aware of their worthlessness
We can recognise a category of very pardonable Obscurantists This would include the men who take fright before a new discovery is tested fearing that it might become a dangerous weapon in the hands of agitators Such doubts are praiseworthy prior to verification But under the term Philosophical Obscurantists I mean to include only those haughty men whose motto is nil sub sole novum26 and who pretend that there is nothing more to be discovered that their science has perfectibilised all perfectible perfectibilities
This distinction of the philosophers into Expectants and Obscurantists allows everyone the chance to justify himself A philosopher is exonerated in placing himself in the category of the Expectants who are waiting for enlightenment and in condemning the four sciences that are indulgently described as uncertain when they might better be called deceiving What other name can be given
To modern Metaphysics which has spawned the sects of Materialism and Atheism and cast the intellect into a scientific dead end by bogging it down in the useless controversy over ideology Had the metaphysicians devoted themselves to their assigned task the study of attraction this would have led in a few years to the discovery of the laws of passional harmony
To Politics which vaunts the rights of man but fails to guarantee the first right and the only useful one which is the right to work The acknowledgment of this right would have sufficed to cast suspicion on civilisation which can neither recognise it nor grant it
To Economism which promises wealth to nations but only teaches the art of enriching financiers and leeches the art of doubling taxes of devouring the future through fiscal loans and of neglecting all research on domestic association the basis of the economy
To Moralism which after two thousand years of advocating the scorn of wealth and the love of truth has just recently begun to extol the civilised commercial system with its bankruptcy usury speculation and freedom of deception
Such are the four sciences which direct the social world or rather which have been misdirecting it for twenty five centuries These sciences are already suspect in the eyes of the revolutionaries whom they have begotten Bonaparte eliminated them all from the Institute and this was perhaps the most sensible act of his reign27

Philosophy was right to vaunt liberty it is the foremost desire of all creatures But philosophy forgot that in civilised societies liberty is illusory if the common people lack wealth When the wage earning classes are poor their independence is as fragile as a house without foundations The free man who lacks wealth immediately sinks back under the yoke of the rich The newly freed slave takes fright at the need of providing for his own subsistence and hastens to sell himself back into slavery in order to escape this new anxiety that hangs over him like Damocles sword In thoughtlessly giving him liberty without wealth you merely replace his physical torment with a mental torment He finds life burdensome in his new state  Thus when you give liberty to the people it must be bolstered by two supports which are the guarantee of comfort and industrial attraction 
Equality of rights is another chimera praiseworthy when considered in the abstract and ridiculous from the standpoint of the means employed to introduce it in civilisation The first right of men is the right to work and the right to a minimum This is precisely what has gone unrecognised in all the constitutions Their primary concern is with favoured individuals who are not in need of work They begin with pompous lists of the elect from privileged families to whom the law guarantees an income of fifty or one hundred thousand francs for the simple task of governing the people or sitting in an upholstered seat and voting with the majority in a senate If the first page of the constitutions serves to provide administrators with guarantees of affluence and idleness it would be well for the second page to pay some attention to the lot of the lower classes to the proportional minimum and the right to work which are omitted in all constitutions and to the right to pleasure which is guaranteed only by the mechanism of the industrial series 
Lets turn to fraternity Our discussion here will be amusing at once loathsome and learned It is amusing in view of the imbecility of the theories which have purported to establish fraternity It is loathsome when one recalls the horrors that the ideal of fraternity has masked But it is a problem which deserves particular attention from science for societies will attain their goal and man his dignity only when universal fraternity has become an established fact By universal fraternity we mean a degree of general intimacy which can only be realised if four conditions are satisfied
Comfort for the people and the assurance of a splendid minimum
The education and instruction of the lower classes
General truthfulness in work relations
The rendering of reciprocal services by unequal classes
Once these four conditions are met the rich Mondor will have truly fraternal relations with Irus who despite his poverty will have no need of a protector and no motive to deceive anyone and whose fine education will enable him to associate with princes  As for the present how could there by any fraternity between sybarites steeped in refinements and our coarse hungry peasants who are covered with rags and often with vermin and who carry contagious diseases like typhus mange
plica and other such fruits of civilised poverty What sort of fraternity could ever be established between such heterogeneous classes of men

By dint of compiling the reveries of classical antiquity modern philosophers have come to espouse the prejudices of their forefathers and notably the most ridiculous prejudice the conviction that the good can be established by governmental action Neither the ancient nor the modern civilisations have ever conceived of a measure which did not rely on government Are they unaware that any civilised administration however organised prefers its own good to that of the people What has been the result of the theories designed to curb the powers of government What has been the use of ministerial responsibility the balance of powers and other notions equally devoid of sense Experiments with these scientific visions have only served to convince us that the nature of the civilised mechanism imposes the prompt re establishment of the abuses that we try to banish Civilisation is a social plague on the planet and vices are just as necessary to it as is a virus to disease The reforms that you seek to impose by governmental action only serve to confirm existing abuses After much effort you bow under their yoke and all you gain for your efforts is the conviction of an inexorable bondage
What fatal circumstance has caused the modern sciences to attain gigantic stature in physics and the arts and to remain dwarfs in the subalternate science of politics Civilised genius even in its most brilliant periods has never created anything for the happiness of the common people At Athens as at Paris the beggar standing at the palace gate has always served to demonstrate the nullity of your political wisdom and the reprobation of nature against your social theories You have not even managed to accomplish half of the reforms which were possible in civilisation Although you could not have rooted out the vices which degrade civilisation you could have mitigated them You could have given civilisation a polish of splendour and unity which would have made its present situation seem like a state of ruin All you can do is to look backwards in politics you praise yourself for the avoidance of evil before attaining the good Like the child who thinks himself a mighty man at the age of four because he has beaten up a three year old you think yourself wise for having banished from your societies a few of the horrors which reduce the barbarian to an even lower condition than your own But just how much progress have you made toward the good when mendacity and thievery venality and bribery reign perpetually in your disgusting civilisation

The Study of Groups

The term group is conventionally applied to any sort of gathering even to a band of idlers who come together out of boredom with no passion or purpose  even to an assemblage of empty minded individuals who are busy killing time and waiting for something to happen In the theory of the passions the term group refers to a number of individuals who are united by a shared taste for the exercise of a particular function Three men have dinner together they are served a soup which pleases two of them and displeases the third on this occasion they do not make up a group because they are in discord about the function that occupies them They do not share a common passionate inclination for the soup
The two individuals who like the soup form a false group To be properly organised and susceptible to passionate equilibrium a group must include at least three members It must be arranged like a set of scales which consists of three forces of which the middle one keeps the two extremities in balance In short no group can be composed of less than three people sharing a common inclination for the performance of a particular function
One might object Although these three men are in discord about the trifling matter of the soup they are in agreement about the main purpose of the get together which is friendship They are close friends In this case I would answer that the group is defective because it is simple the only tie that binds it is a spiritual one To make it into a compound group a sensual bond would have to be added a soup liked by all three members of the group
Bah If the three are not in agreement about the soup they will have shared preferences for other kinds of food In any case the group actually does have two bonds for besides the bond of friendship these three men are united by the bond of ambition they are in cabalistic league They have gotten together for dinner in order to hatch an electoral intrigue So theres the double link the compound bond that you require
This would only be a bastard compound relationship formed by two spiritual bonds The pure compound demands a mixture of the pleasures of the soul and those of the senses without any sort of dissidence In this case the meal begins with a disagreement about the soup and the group is falsified despite the double bond 
Since passionate series are composed only of groups it is necessary first of all to learn how to form groups
Ha Ha Groups What a silly subject that is It must be very amusing to talk about groups
This is the way our wits reason when one talks about groups At the start you are always subjected to a salvo of stale jokes But whether the subject is comical or not it is certain that people know nothing about groups and that they dont even know how to form a proper group of three people much less one of thirty
We have numerous treatises on the study of man But what can they tell us about the subject if they neglect the essential portion the analysis of groups In all our relationships we persistently tend to form groups and they have never been an object of study
Civilised people having an instinct for the false are constantly inclined to prefer the false to the true As the pivot of their social system they have chosen a group which is essentially false the conjugal couple This group is false because it only includes two members it is false in its lack of liberty it is false in the conflicts or differing inclinations which break out from the very start of married life over expenses food friends and a hundred other little details like the degree of heat in an apartment If people do not know how to harmonise basic groups of two or three people they must be even less able to harmonise the whole
I have been speaking only about sub groups whose minimum size is three people A full group in the societary system must include at least seven members for it must include three sub divisions or sub groups The central sub group must be stronger than either of the two extremities which it keeps in balance A group of seven may be divided into three sub divisions consisting of two three and two members Each of these sub groups devotes itself to one aspect of a given activity Groups consisting of two members are false when they act in isolation but here they are admissible since their activity is linked to that of others
The central sub group  which consists of three people is in a state of balance with the two extreme sub groups  consisting of two members each The reason for this is that in any activity the central sub group always performs the most attractive functions the greater attraction of its functions compensates for its numerical weakness Thus its influence within the group is equal to that of the four other members who perform two different functions 
A group is sufficiently large if it includes seven members but it is more perfect with nine members Then its three subgroups can be supplemented by a pivot or leader and an ambiguous or transitional member For example

Transition1ambiguous member
Higher wing2intermediate members
Center3initiates
Lower wing2beginners
Pivot1leader
This division emerges naturally in any gathering for work or pleasure if the passions and instincts are allowed to express themselves freely Man has an instinctual aversion to equality and a penchant for hierarchical patterns Thus when free expression is permitted this nuanced hierarchical scale will emerge in a series of nine groups just as it will in a group composed of nine individuals
There must be at least seven members in a full group and at least twenty four in a full series But to replace individuals who are sick or absent it is better for each group to consist of twelve and each series of forty members In this way each group and series will be assured of having its full complement of leaders and ambiguous members

The series of groups is the method adopted by God in the organisation of the kingdoms of nature and of all created things The naturalists in their theories and classifications have unanimously accepted this system of organisation they could not have departed from it without coming into conflict with nature and falling into confusion28 
If human passions and personalities were not subject like the material realms to organisation by series of groups man would be out of unity with the universe there would be duplicity of system and incoherence between the material and passional worlds If man aspires to social unity he should seek it by adhering to the serial order to which God has subjected all of nature
A passionate series is a league or affiliation of several small groups each animated by some nuance or variety of a passion The passion in question is the generic passion for the whole series Thus if twenty groups cultivate twenty different types of roses the generic passion of their series is rose growing the groups cultivating the white rose the yellow rose the moss rose etc represent its varieties
To take another example twelve groups are engaged in the cultivation of twelve different flowers The tulip is cultivated by one group the jonquil by another etc These twelve groups together constitute a series of flower growers whose generic function is the cultivation of flowers The flowers are distributed according to a scale of tastes each group cultivating the variety of flower for which it has a special fondness
Passions limited to a single individual are not admissible in the serial mechanism Three individuals  A B C  like their bread salted in different ways A likes his almost unsalted B likes his moderately salted C prefers heavily salted bread These three people are in a state of graduated dissonance which does not lend itself to the creation of serial accords For such accords to take place there must be a number of groups linked in ascending and descending order
A proper group should have from seven to nine members at the minimum in order to permit the development of balanced or equilibrated rivalries among its members In the passionate series then we cannot base our calculations upon isolated individuals The intrigues of a series could not be maintained by twelve individuals with a passion for the cultivation of twelve different flowers This will be proved in the body of the treatise For the time being it should be kept in mind that the term passionate series always refers to an affiliation of groups and never of individuals
Thus the three individuals mentioned above  A B C  could not form a series of breadists or bread lovers But if instead of three people we suppose thirty  namely eight of taste A ten of taste B twelve of taste C  they would form a passionate series that is an affiliation of groups with graduated and contrasted tastes Their joint activity and their cabalistic discords would create the intrigues necessary to bake excellent bread and grow fine wheat29 
The passionate series always strive toward some useful end such as the increase of wealth or the perfection of work even when they are engaged in leisure activities like music
A series cannot be organised with less than three groups for it needs a middle element to keep the two contrasting extremes in balance A balance may also be established among four groups provided their properties and relations correspond to those of a geometrical proportion
When there are more than four groups in a series they should be divided into three bodies forming a center and two wings or into four bodies forming a quadrille In each body of groups the varieties which are closely allied and homogeneous are united
The societary order must thus employ and develop all varieties of taste and character in a scale of nuanced gradations It forms a group to represent each variety without making any judgment concerning the merit of a particular taste All tastes and penchants are good and they all have their uses provided they can be made to form a series with ascending and descending wings and transitional groups at either extreme to represent uncommon and peculiar tastes When a series is arranged in this manner according to the methods which will be explained in the body of the treatise each of its groups will cooperate harmonically with all the others be they a hundred in number The groups will resemble the cogs in a wheel which are all useful provided they mesh properly
The calculus of the passionate series is going to establish a principle flattering to the whole human race it will demonstrate that all tastes which are not harmful or annoying to others have a valuable function in the societary state They will become useful as soon as they are developed in series  that is according to a graduated scale in which each nuance of taste is represented by a group
Thus the theory of association is nothing more than the art of forming and activating passionate series As soon as this science has been discovered on a globe it can at once establish social unity and attain individual and collective happiness Thus it is a matter of urgent necessity for the human race to acquire a knowledge of this theory
The passionate series must be contrasted interlocked and kept in a state of rivalry and exaltation A series failing to fulfil these conditions could not perform its functions in the mechanism of Harmony
A series must be contrasted  that is its groups must be arranged in ascending and descending order Thus to form a series of a hundred individuals classed according to age the following division should be adopted
Ascending Wing Groups of infants and children
Center of the Series Groups of adolescents and adults
Descending Wing Groups of aged persons
The same method should be followed in classifying series of passions and character traits
This method serves to bring out contrasts and hence to produce enthusiasm in the various groups Each group becomes passionately addicted to its own dominant penchant or special taste At the same time it develops contrasting tastes and penchants and it becomes critical of the penchants and occupations of the contiguous groups in the series with which it is in rivalry
This system of progressive or graduated classification creates sympathies and alliances between the contrasted groups and a antipathies or dissidences between contiguous groups with similar tastes
The series needs discords as much as it needs harmonies It must be stimulated by a host of rival pretensions which will give rise to cabalistic alliances and become a spur to emulation Without contrasts it would be impossible to form leagues between the groups and create enthusiasm the series would lack ardour for its labours and its work would be inferior in quality and quantity
The second necessary condition is to establish intrigues and active rivalries within a series Since this should result from the regularity of contrasts and the graduated distribution of nuances or varieties it may be said that this second condition is fulfilled once the first is satisfied Of course there is more to say about the means by which intrigues are created but that will come later
The third condition to be fulfilled is that of the meshing or linkage of the different series This can take place only if the groups change their work at frequent intervals say every hour or at most every two hours For example a man may be employed
At 5 00 AM in a group of shepherds
At 7 00 A M in a group of field workers
At 9 00 A M in a group of gardeners
A session of two hours duration is the longest admissible in Harmony enthusiasm cannot last any longer than that If the work is unattractive in itself the session should be reduced to one hour
In the example just given the three series of shepherds fieldworkers and gardeners will become meshed by the process of reciprocal interchange of members It is not necessary for this interchange to be complete  for each of the twenty men engaged in tending flocks to go off and work in the fields at 700 All that is necessary is for each series to provide the others with several members taken from its different groups The exchange of a few members will suffice to establish a linkage or meshing between the different series
A passionate series acting in isolation would be useless and could perform no functions of a harmonic character Nothing would be easier than to organise one or more industrial series in a large city like Paris They might be engaged in the growing of flowers or fruit or anything else but they would be completely useless At least fifty series are necessary to fulfil the third condition that of meshing It is for this reason that the theory of association cannot be tried out on a small number of people say twenty families or one hundred individuals At least four hundred people  men women and children  would be necessary to form and mesh the fifty series required to activate the mechanism of simple association To organise a compound association at least four hundred series requiring fifteen or sixteen hundred people would be needed

The Establishment of a Trial Phalanx

We will suppose that the trial is made by a monarch or by a wealthy individual like one of the Devonshires Northumberlands Bedforts the Sheremetevs Labanovs Czartoryskis the Esterhazys Belmontes Medina Celis the Barings Lafittes Hopes etc or finally by a powerful company which desires to avoid all tentative measures and proceed directly to the organisation of Full Harmony the eighth period in its plenitude I am going to indicate the procedure to follow in this case
An association of 1500 or 1600 people requires a site comprising at least one square league of land that is to say a surface area of six million square toises30  Let us not forget that one third as much would suffice for the simple mode
A good stream of water should be available the land should be hilly and suitable for a variety of crops there should be a forest nearby and the site should be fairly near a large city but far enough away to avoid unwelcome visitors
The trial Phalanx will stand alone and it will get no help from neighbouring Phalanxes As a result of this isolation there will be so many gaps in attraction so many passional calms to fear in its manoeuvres that it will be particularly important to provide it with the help of a good site fit for a variety of functions Flat country like that surrounding Anvers Leipzig or Orleans would be quite inappropriate and would cause the breakdown of many series owing to the uniformity of the land surface It will therefore be necessary to select a diversified region like that near Lausanne or at the very least a fine valley provided with a stream and a forest like the valley from Brussels to Halle A fine location near Paris would be the stretch of land between Poissy and Conflans Poissy and Meulan
The 1500 or 1600 people brought together will be in a state of graduated inequality as to wealth age personality and theoretical and practical knowledge The group should be as varied as possible for the greater the variety in the passions and faculties of the members the easier it will be to harmonise them in a limited amount of time
All possible types of agricultural work should be represented in this trial community including that involving hot houses and conservatories There should also be at least three types of manufacturing work for winter and for rainy days as well as diverse types of work in the applied sciences and arts apart from what is taught in the schools A passional series will be assigned to each type of work and it will divide up its members into subdivisions and groups according to the instructions given earlier
At the very outset an evaluation should be made of the capital deposited as shares in the enterprise land material flocks tools etc This matter is one of the first to be dealt with and I shall discuss it in detail further on Let us now confine ourselves to saying that all these deposits of material will be represented by transferable shares in the association31 Let us leave these minute reckonings and turn our attention to the workings of attraction
A great difficulty to be overcome in the trial Phalanx will be the formation of transcendent ties or collective bonds among the series before the end of the warm season Before winter comes a passionate union must be established between the members they must be made to feel a sense of collective and individual devotion to the Phalanx and above all a perfect harmony must be established concerning the division of profits among the three elements Capital Labour and Talent
The difficulty will be greater in northern countries than in those of the south given the fact that the growing season lasts eight months in the south and just five months in the north
Since a trial Phalanx must begin with agricultural labour it will not be in full operation until the month of May  in a climate of 50 degrees latitude like the region around London or Paris and since the general bonds the harmonic ties of the series must be established before the end of the farming season in October there will scarcely be five months of full activity in regions of fifty degrees latitude Everything will have to be done in that short time
Thus it would be much easier to make the trial in a region where the climate is temperate for instance near Florence Naples Valencia or Lisbon where the growing season lasts eight or nine months In such an area it would be particularly easy to consolidate the bonds of union since there would only be three or four months of passional calm between the end of the first season and the beginning of the second By the second spring with the renewal of its agricultural labours the Phalanx would form its ties and cabals anew with much greater zeal and with more intensity than in the first year The Phalanx would thenceforth be in a state of complete consolidation and strong enough to avoid passional calms during the second winter
If instead of being surrounded by civilised populations the trial Phalanx had neighbours who had been brought up in the seventh period or merely in the sixth it could count on moral support which would lend strength to its intrigues and help it in getting organised But in fact it will be surrounded only by those social vipers who are called civilised  Progenies viperarum as the Gospel puts it  people whose deceitful proximity will be a spiritual menace to the first Phalanx just as a horde of plague bearers would be a material menace to a healthy city This city would be obliged to drive them away and to level its cannons against those who approached its walls
The experimental Phalanx will be obliged to take similar actions in a moral sense against the contagion of civilised customs It will be forced to withdraw itself from all passional or spiritual relations with its perfidious neighbours  It should be recalled that the two terms passional and spiritual are synonymous by contrast to material
The civilised are so accustomed to falsity that they practice it even in those circumstances when they would like to practice truthfulness Propriety and morality make liars out of civilised men With such habits the civilised would destroy the mechanism of Harmony if they were permitted to interfere
This mistrust will not prevent the first Harmonians from admitting a few civilised people as spectators consigned to a moral quarantine and this conditional admission will be the object of a highly lucrative speculation which will yield a profit of some twenty millions to the trial Phalanx if it handles the matter skillfully  The figures will be given farther on
Let us discuss the composition of the trial Phalanx At least seven eighths of its members should be people involved in farming or industry The remainder will consist of capitalists savants and artists  The Phalanx would be poorly graduated and difficult to balance if among its capitalists there were several worth 100000 francs and several worth 50000 francs without any of intermediate wealth In such circumstances one should try to find men with fortunes of 60 70 80 and 90000 francs The most precisely graduated Phalanx yields the highest degree of social harmony and the greatest profits
In readying the gardens and workshops of the trial Phalanx one should try to predict and estimate the approximate quantity of attraction which each branch of industry is likely to excite For example we know that the plum tree has less attraction than the pear tree and so we will plant fewer plum trees than pear trees The quantity of attraction will be  the sole rule to follow in each branch of agricultural and manufacturing work
Economists would follow a different line of reasoning They would insist that it is necessary to cultivate whatever produces the greatest yield and to produce a large quantity of the most productive objects The trial Phalanx should avoid this error its methods should be different from those of the Phalanxes that will follow it When all regions have embraced Harmony and when they are all organised in combination with each other then it will no doubt be necessary to adapt farming to the dictates of interest and attraction But the goal of the experimental community is quite different it is to get a group of 1500 or 1600 people working out of pure attraction If one could predict that they would be more actively attracted to work by thistles and thorns than by orchards and flowers then it would be necessary to give up orchards and flowers and replace them with thistles and thorns in the experimental community
In point of fact as soon as it has attained its two goals industrial attraction and passional equilibrium the trial Phalanx will have the means to widen the scope of its labours so as to include any useful tasks which may have been neglected at the outset Moreover its strength will be doubled when neighbouring communities organise their own Phalanxes and when the whole region is able to intervene in the mechanism of attraction Thus in the initial experiment it is necessary to concentrate on the creation of industrial attraction without being particular about the type of work involved
I have had to insist on this point because the critics may wonder at the fact that I require for the first community a great many flowers orchards and small animals but very little in the way of large scale agriculture The reason for this is that some of the stimuli which make large scale farming attractive will only emerge after the establishment of a network of Phalanxes capable of aiding each other The first community which will be deprived of such resources should adopt appropriate tactics and resolve the problem of industrial attraction by the means at its disposal
The most appealing species of animals and vegetables are fairly well known and it will be easy to estimate the proportions to be respected in the industrial preparations for the experimental Phalanx Of course there will necessarily be some errors at the outset and it will take several years before a Phalanx can make an exact reckoning of the proportions to be established among all types of work
Yet since the capital invested in the establishment of the trial Phalanx will be reimbursed at a rate of twelve to one the shareholders will scarcely be inclined to worry about the fact that a few errors in the distribution of labour will reduce profits during the first years The main point will be to attain the goal of industrial attraction and passional equilibrium This will be the sign of victory and the shareholders or founders should keep in mind that when they have obtained this victory when they have provided a practical demonstration of the equilibrium of the passions and shown the way to a happy future their fellow men will find all the worlds treasures inadequate to reward them for having provided an escape from the labyrinth of civilisation barbarism and savagery

The edifice occupied by the Phalanx bears no resemblance to our urban or rural buildings and in the establishment of a full Harmony of 1600 people none of our buildings could be put to use not even a great palace like Versailles nor a great monastery like Escorial If an experiment is made in minimal Harmony with two or three hundred members or on a limited scale with four hundred members it would be possible although difficult to use a monastery or palace  like Meudon for the central edifice
The lodgings gardens and stables of a society run by series of groups must be vastly different from those of our villages and towns which are perversely organised and meant for families having no societary relations Instead of the chaos of little houses which rival each other in filth and ugliness in our towns a Phalanx constructs for itself a building as perfect as the terrain permits Here is a brief account of the measures to be taken on a favourable site 
The center of the palace or Phalanstery should be a place for quiet activity it should include the dining rooms the exchange meeting rooms library studies etc This central section includes the temple the tower the telegraph the coops for carrier pigeons the ceremonial chimes the observatory and a winter courtyard adorned with resinous plants The parade grounds are located just behind the central section
One of the wings of the Phalanstery should include all the noisy workshops like the carpenter shop and the forge and the other workshops where hammering is done It should also be the place for all the industrial gatherings involving children who are generally very noisy at work and even at music The grouping of these activities will avoid an annoying drawback of our civilised cities where every street has its own hammerer or iron merchant or beginning clarinet player to shatter the ear drums of fifty families in the vicinity
The other wing should contain the caravansary with its ballrooms and its halls for meetings with outsiders who should not be allowed to encumber the center of the palace and to disturb the domestic relations of the Phalanx This precaution of isolating outsiders and concentrating their meetings in one of the wings will be most important in the trial Phalanx For the Phalanx will attract thousands of curiosity seekers whose entry fees will provide a profit that I cannot estimate at less than twenty million 
The phalanstery or manor house of the Phalanx should contain in addition to the private apartments a large number of halls for social relations These halls will be called Seristeries or places for the meeting and interaction of the passional series
These halls have nothing in common with our public rooms where ungraduated social relations prevail A series cannot tolerate this confusion it always has its three four or five divisions which occupy three four or five adjacent locations This means that analogous arrangements are necessary for the officers and members of each division Thus each Seristery ordinarily consists of three principal halls one for the center and two for the wings of the series
In addition the three halls of the Seristery should have adjoining rooms for the groups and committees of the series In the banquet Seristery or dining room for example six halls of unequal size are necessary

1first class hall in the Ascending Wingabout 150 people
2second class halls in the Center   400      
3third class halls In the Descending Wing   900     
Near these six halls of unequal size there should be a number of smaller rooms for the diverse groups which wish to isolate themselves from the common dining rooms of their class It happens every day that some groups wish to eat separately they should have rooms near the Seristery where meals are served to the members of their class
In all social relations it is necessary to have small rooms adjoining the Seristery in order to encourage small group meetings Accordingly a Seristery or the meeting place of a series is arranged in a compound manner with halls for large collective gatherings and for smaller cabalistic meetings This system is very different from that employed in our large assemblies where even in the palaces of kings everyone is thrown together pell mell according to the holy philosophical principle of equality This principle is completely intolerable in Harmony
The stables granaries and warehouses should be located if possible opposite the main edifice The space between the palace and the stables will serve as a main courtyard or parade ground and it should be very large To give some idea of the proper dimensions I estimate that the front of the Phalanstery should have a length of about 600 toises de Paris The center and the parade grounds will run to about 300 toises and each of the two wings to about 150  The gardens should be placed insofar as possible behind the palace and not behind the stables since large scale farming should be done in the area near the stables These plans will of course vary according to local circumstances we are only talking here about an ideal location 
All the children both rich and poor are lodged together on the mezzanine of the Phalanstery For they should be kept separate from the adolescents and in general from all those who are capable of making love at most times and particularly during the late evening and the early morning hours The reasons for this will be explained later For the time being let us assume that those who are capable of forming amorous relations will be concentrated on the second floor while the very young and the very old  the first and sixteenth choirs the Tots and the Patriarchs should have meeting halls on the ground floor and the mezzanine They should also be isolated from the street gallery which is the most important feature of a Phalanstery and which cannot be conceived of in civilisation For this reason it should be briefly described in a separate chapter

An Architectural Innovation The Street Gallery

The street galleries are a mode of internal communication which would alone be sufficient to inspire disdain for the palaces and great cities of civilisation Once a man has seen the street galleries of a Phalanx he will look upon the most elegant civilised palace as a place of exile a residence worthy of fools who after three thousand years of architectural studies have not yet learned how to build themselves healthy and comfortable lodgings In civilisation we can only conceive of luxury in the simple mode we have no conception of the compound or collective forms of luxury 
The poorest wretch in Harmony a man who doesnt have a penny to his name has a well heated and enclosed portico at his disposal when he gets into a carriage he goes from the Palace to the stables by means of paved and gravelled underground passage ways he gets from his lodgings to the public halls and workshops by means of street galleries which are heated in winter and ventilated in summer In Harmony one can pass through the workshops stables shops ball rooms banquet and assembly halls etc in January without knowing whether it is rainy or windy hot or cold The detailed treatment which I shall give to this subject entitles me to say that if after three thousand years of study the civilised have not vet learned how to house themselves it is no wonder that they have not yet learned how to direct and harmonise their passions When one fails in the most minute material calculations one is likely to fail in the great calculations concerning the passions
Let us describe the street galleries which are one of the most charming and precious features of a Palace of Harmony A Phalanx which may consist of up to 1600 or 1800 people is actually a small town in itself the more so in that it has a large number of adjacent rural buildings of the sort that our proprietors and city dwellers relegate to their country residences
The Phalanx has no outside streets or open road ways exposed to the elements All the portions of the central edifice can be traversed by means of a wide gallery which runs along the second floor of the whole building At each extremity of this spacious corridor there are elevated passages supported by columns and also attractive underground passages which connect all the parts of the Phalanx and the adjoining buildings Thus everything is linked by a series of passage ways which are sheltered elegant and comfortable in winter thanks to the help of heaters and ventilators
These sheltered passage ways are particularly necessary in view of the fact that there is a great deal of movement in Harmony In conformity with the laws of the eleventh and twelfth passions  the Butterfly and the Composite the sessions of the various work and recreation groups never last more than one or two hours If the Harmonians were obliged to go out of doors in moving from one hall to another from a stable to a workshop it would take just one week of wintry damp weather to leave even the most robust of them beset by colds inflammations and pleurisy A state of things which requires so much moving about makes sheltered means of communication an absolute necessity
The street gallery or continuous peristyle extends along the second story It could not be placed on the ground floor since the lower part of the building will be traversed by carriage entrances Those who have seen the gallery of the Louvre may take it as a model for the street gallery in Harmony It will be taller than the Louvre however and the windows will be differently placed
The street galleries of a Phalanx wind along just one side of the central edifice and stretch to the end of each of its wings All of these wings contain a double row of rooms Thus one row of rooms looks out upon the fields and gardens and the other looks out upon the street gallery The street gallery then will be three stories high with windows on one side The entrance to all the apartments of the second third and fourth stories is located in the street gallery Flights of stairs are placed at intervals to ascend to the upper stories 
After thirty years when permanent buildings are constructed the street gallery will have a width of six toises in the central portion of the Palace and four toises in the wings But at the outset since the present poverty of the globe requires modest structures  the street gallery will be only four toises wide in the center and three in the wings 
The main body of the building will have a width of about eight toises not including the street gallery This will allow room to put alcoves and toilets in all of the apartments  The minimum lodging for a member of the poorest class will thus include a room an alcove and a private toilet 
The kitchens and some of the public halls will be located on the ground floor There will also be trap doors in the floors of the dining rooms on the second story Thus the tables may be set in the kitchens below and simply raised through the trapdoors when it is time to eat These trap doors will be particularly useful during festivities such as the visits of travelling caravans and legions when there will be too many people to eat in the ordinary dining rooms Then double rows of tables will be set in the street galleries and the food will be passed up from the kitchen
The principal public halls should not be situated on the ground floor There are two reasons for this The first is that the patriarchs and children who have difficulty climbing stairs should be lodged in the lower parts of the building The second is that the children should be kept in isolation from the non industrial activities of the adults 
To spend a winters day in a Phalanstery to visit all parts of it without exposure to the elements to go to the theatre and the opera in light clothes and coloured shoes without worrying about the mud and the cold would be a charm so novel that it alone would suffice to make our cities and castles seem detestable If the Phalanstery were put to civilised uses the mere convenience of its sheltered heated and ventilated passage ways would make it enormously valuable

The Phalanx at Dawn

Every meal has a character of its own a tone which is the same in all three classes I will limit myself to describing the character of the anthem32 or first meal which is served in the very early morning before anyone has left the palace The anthem is not a very orderly meal it is marked by a pleasing confusion Since people get up at different times it is divided into three stages there is the first anthem for a few groups who go out to work very early then there is the big central anthem for the majority of the groups which set off an hour later finally there is the post anthem for late risers 
The central anthem which takes place around five oclock in the morning is gay and attractive in all respects It provides an occasion for the presentation of distinguished travellers who have spent the night at the Phalanx As people arrive for this meal they are able to read reports and news dispatches which have arrived during the night they learn about the plays to be performed in neighbouring Phalanxes about the movements of caravans and industrial armies the voyages of the various paladins of the globe In addition they find the various newspapers which have arrived during the night either from the Congress of Unity which is located on the Bosphorus or from the secondary congresses of the Amazon the Chesapeake etc
The anthem also serves as a second Exchange it is an occasion at which the negotiations of the previous day may be modified if necessary The news which has arrived during the night may necessitate some changes in the arrangements made earlier and it is at the anthem that such matters are settled This task is confided to special acolytes who serve as peripatetic negotiators during the course of the meal
All of these distractions make the anthem a very chaotic meal a most satisfying imbroglio including many other surprises of which I will refrain from speaking since they do not coincide with our customs I might add that all by itself the anthem would suffice to get the most sluggish individual out of bed by five in the morning were he not already excited by the desire to participate in the sessions of his groups Thus by the end of the central anthem it would be unusual to find one eighth of the Phalanx still in bed
In warm weather the central anthem concludes with the little morning parade which I will now describe I will assume that it is held at five oclock in the morning
Shortly before five the peals of a carillon announce the little parade and the hymn to the dawn Those who are finishing their meal make ready the musicians get their instruments the priests and parade officers adjust their decorations etc The clocks strike five The Athlete Conradin who is fourteen years old and ranks as a Major on the parade staff gives the command to form groups I have already said that the officers for the little parade come from the choir of Athletes Thus Conradins adjutants are also thirteen or fourteen years old they are Antenor and Amphion for the groups of boys and Clorinde and Galatea for the groups of girls Amphion and Galatea set about bringing together the members of the orchestras while Antenor and Clorinde start to place people in proper marching order Ranks are formed in the following manner
I will suppose that the procession consists of 400 people  men women and children  and that they make up twenty groups which are all ready to set out into the country The twenty standard bearers form a line facing the colonnade The whole throng is divided like an orchestra into separate vocal and instrumental sections each of which is headed by its own priest or priestess Before the priests there are basins of burning incense tended by the Tots A hierophant or high priest stands between the lines of men and women the drummers and trumpeters are next to the colonnade and the animals and wagons are drawn up in the rear At the center of the entire gathering stands the young Major Conradin His adjutants are at his side and he is preceded by four children from the choir of the neophytes These children carry signal torches which they wave when there are orders to be transmitted to the watch tower The tower in turn relays the orders to the domes of adjacent castles to neighbouring communities and to those groups which have already gone out into the countryside
When all is ready the drums roll the crowd falls silent and the Major orders everyone to bow to God Then the drums and trumpets sound a mighty fanfare and the carillons peal in unison Incense rises flags wave and the colours are hoisted on the spires of the Phalanstery The groups which are already in the fields pause to join in this ceremony as do passing travellers and the members of visiting caravans
When a minute has passed the hierophant calls for the hymn by striking its first three bars on the tuning fork The ritornelle is chanted by the priests and priestesses directing each of the vocal and instrumental sections Then the hymn is sung by all the groups together
When the hymn is over the Little Khan sounds the call to the colours Everyone puts away his instrument and takes his place under the banner of his work group Each group then marches freely and not in perfect ranks toward its animals and wagons  Since the work groups are made up of people of all ages they would be ill advised to march in strict parade order Pushing its wagons each group then parades before the great colonnade where the dignitaries are standing If the parade is just a small one one of the kings paladins may be there but on the days of big parades a paladin of the Emperor of Unity will attend As each group passes the reviewing stand it receives a salute equal to its rank The groups of plowmen and masons who come first are given a fine fanfare and then they proceed to their work
The salute to God circles the earth along with the sun At the equinox a big parade is held at sunrise in every Phalanx Thus the dawn is greeted by a moving ribbon of Phalanxes which stretches for thousands of leagues and as the day advances the hymn to the dawn is sung over the length and breadth of the earth On the two solstices the hymn is sung simultaneously by the whole human race at the moment which corresponds to noon at Constantinople

The internal administration of the Phalanx will be directed at the outset by a regency or council to be composed of those shareholders who have made the greatest contribution in terms of capital and industrial or scientific knowledge If there are women capable of exercising administrative functions they should be included on the council along with the men for in Harmony women are on a par with men in all affairs of interest provided they have the necessary education
Harmony cannot tolerate any general community of goods33 and there can be no collective recompenses to familial or conjugal groups Harmony is obliged to deal with everyone individually even with children who are at least four and a half years old and dividends must be shared according to each individuals contribution in terms of labour capital and talent
It is allowable for relatives couples and friends to share what they possess as is sometimes done in civilisation But in the dealings of the Phalanx with its members even with five year old children individual accounts are kept A childs earnings are not given to his father and once he reaches the age of four and a half a child becomes the owner of the fruits of his own labour as well as of the legacies inheritances and interests which he may have acquired These are kept from him by the Phalanx until he comes of age  that is until he is nineteen or twenty and able to advance from the sixth tribe the lads and lasses to the seventh the adolescents34 
After having evaluated the land machines materials furniture supplies and liquid capital contributed by each member the regency issues 1728 exchangeable shares These shares are backed by the property of the Phalanx its land buildings flocks workshops etc The regency issues these shares or portions thereof to each member in accordance with his contribution to the Phalanx It is possible to be a member without being a shareholder it is also possible to be an outside shareholder without being an active member In the second case a person has no right to the two portions of the revenue of the Phalanx which are assigned to labour and to talent
The annual profits are divided into three unequal portions and distributed in the following manner
5 12 to manual labour
4 12 to invested capital
3 12 to theoretical and practical knowledge
According to his abilities each member can belong to any or all of these three categories35 
In connection with its administrative responsibilities the regency gives each poor member an advance of one years clothing food and lodging36 This advance entails no risk because it is certain that the work which the poor man will perform under the stimulus of attraction and pleasure will produce a yield in excess of the advances made to him After the annual inventory the Phalanx will find itself in debt to all the poor members to whom it has advanced the minimum This minimum includes 1 Board of five meals a day in the third class dining room 2 Decent clothing including work  and dress uniforms as well as all the tools and implements needed for farming and industrial work 3 Lodging consisting of a private room with toilet and also access to the public halls and festivities of the third class and to the stalls reserved for the third class at the theatre
At the outset before the Phalanx makes its first harvests the regency is responsible for the purchase of provisions but their use and management is to be entrusted to the gastronomic series
If the Phalanx is composed of 1500 members they will be roughly divided into the following gastronomic categories

900 members of the third class
300 members of the second class 
100 members of the first class
   50 members eating food prepared to order37
In all there will be five series devoted to the preparation of food in addition to the four categories mentioned above there will also be separate cooking for the animals who will be plentiful and well treated in Harmony
Each of the categories noted above will be divided into subdivisions corresponding to the three sexes38 There will be separate types of cooking for men women and children  Each of the three sexes will have its own tables and dining rooms They will sometimes eat together in groups of various sizes at lunch or supper But ordinarily there will be no sexual mixing at dinner which is a meal during which each of the sexes will engage in its own gastrosophic cabals 
Children will not dine at the same table with their fathers This civilised custom would put a crimp on the studies of the fathers and the pleasures of the children It will be enough for them to eat together at the two small meals the delite39 and the afternoon snack But the two middle sized meals breakfast and supper as well as the pivotal meal or dinner will be arranged more methodically and according to the wishes of attraction These arrangements will be perfectly free they will be in strict conformity with the wishes of the passions We are unable to recognise these wishes in the present order which distorts the play of the passions In reading this sketch a father may say But I enjoy dining with my wife and my children and I will continue to do so come what may Such an attitude is quite mistaken Today for want of anything better a father may enjoy eating with his wife and his children But when he has spent two days in Harmony and taken the bait of the intrigues and cabals of the series the father will wish to dine with his own cabalistic groups He will send off his wife and his children who for their part will ask nothing better than to be done with the lugubrious family dinner
Since no coercive measures are tolerated in Harmony the work to be done is indicated but not ordered by the Areopagus which is the supreme industrial council It is composed of the high ranking officers of each series and it serves as an advisory body with regard to passional affairs Its opinions and decisions are subordinated to the wishes of attraction and each series remains free to make decisions concerning its own industrial interests Thus the Areopagus cannot order that the mowing or harvesting be done it can only declare that a certain time is propitious according to the available meteorological or agronomic data thereupon each series acts according to its wishes But its wishes can scarcely differ from those of the Areopagus whose opinion is held in high esteem

No series has more members than that of the Exchange Insofar as possible everyone in the Phalanx gathers at its sessions which are held every day to plan the activities of the following days They take place at nightfall at the time when everyone is returning to the Phalanstery and when there is little or no activity in the kitchens and gardens
There is much more animation and intrigue at the Exchange of a Phalanx than there is at the stock exchanges of London or Amsterdam For every individual must go to the Exchange to arrange his work and pleasure sessions for the following days It is there that he makes plans concerning his gastronomic and amorous meetings and especially for his work sessions in the shops and fields Everyone has at least twenty sessions to arrange since he makes definite plans for the following day and tentative ones for the day after
Assuming that 1200 individuals are present and that each one has twenty sessions to arrange this means that in the meeting as a whole there are 24000 transactions to be concluded Each of these transactions can involve 20 40 or 100 individuals who must be consulted and intrigued with or against It would be impossible to unravel so many intrigues and conclude so many transactions if one proceeded according to the confused methods employed by our commercial exchanges operating at their rate it would take at least a whole day to organise half the meetings that the Harmonians must plan in half an hour I will now describe their expeditious methods
In the center of the hall there is a raised platform on which the director the directrice and their secretaries are seated Scattered around the hall are the desks of 24 negotiators 12 men and 12 women Each of them handles the affairs of a given number of series and serves as the representative of several neighbouring Phalanxes Each of the four secretaries corresponds with six of the 24 negotiators by means of iron wires whose movements indicate requests and decisions
Negotiations are carried on quietly by means of signals Each negotiator holds up the escutcheons of the groups or Phalanxes which he represents and by certain prearranged signs he indicates the approximate number of members which he has recruited Everyone else walks around the hall In one or two circuits a given individual may take part in 20 transactions since all he has to do is to accept or refuse Dorimon suggests that a meeting of the bee keepers be held the next day at ten oclock The leaders of this group have taken the initiative according to the customary procedures Their job is to find out whether or not a majority of the members of the bee keeping group wish to hold a session In this case the decision is affirmative Each of the members takes his peg from the bee keepers board which is placed in front of Dorimons desk 
At the other side of the hall Araminte calls for a meeting of the rose growers to be held at the same time Since many of Aramintes rose growers are also members of the bee keeping group they raise an objection and notify Dorimon He conveys their message to the directorate which tells Araminte to halt his negotiations The rose growers are obliged to choose another hour since bee keeping is a more necessary form of work than rose growing
Negotiations frequently become so complicated that three four or five groups and even complete series find themselves in competition Everything is settled by the signals of the negotiators Their acolytes confer with the leaders of the various conspiring groups by calling them over to one of the desks Every time someone tries to initiate an intrigue either to organise a session or prevent one from being held a conference takes place at some point outside the main promenade area so as not to disturb those who are still walking around the hall watching the progress of negotiations and making up their minds 
When a session of the Exchange is over everyone writes down a list of the meetings which he has agreed to attend and the negotiators and directors draw up a summary of all the transactions This summary is immediately sent to the press and then it is distributed to neighbouring communities by a dog who carries it around his neck
Conflicts and changes of time frequently cause the postponement of sessions News of such postponements is regularly announced in the main hall of the Phalanstery where there are always intermediaries or brokers to initiate new activities and plan meetings which could not be arranged at the evenings Exchange due to conflicts and cabales In all the public halls there are special bureaus to deal with such problems
All of these transactions will be carried on by methods totally unlike those of our stock exchanges where people try to conceal their thoughts and use crafty tactics In the Exchanges of Harmony everyone desires to manifest his intentions and to make them known to all

When a Phalanx gathers for ceremonial occasions such as receptions and important festivities it forms a vast series consisting of thirty two choirs  sixteen male and sixteen female each of which parades with its own special costumes and ornaments This series which can be called the basic series is one of those which has the same distinguishing features throughout the globe In all countries it adopts the thirty two colours specified for each of its thirty two choirs these colours are required only on its pennants plumes and distinctive ornaments
Each of the thirty two choirs has three uniforms for the three seasons  hot cold and moderate Each has its banners its officers and its own special form of corporate enthusiasm all of which serve as powerful stimuli in work and other activities Since I will often be referring to this series it should be described in great detail In the outline that follows I designate under the name of tribes the double choirs of men and women and boys and girls who belong to the same age group

Attractive Labour



Source The History Guide
Translated by Julia Franklin and published as Selections from the Works of Fourier 


    In the civilized mechanism we find everywhere composite unhappiness instead of
    composite charm Let us judge of it by the case of labor It is says the Scripture very
    justly a punishment of man Adam and his issue are condemned to earn their bread by the
    sweat of their brow That already is an affliction but this labor this ungrateful
    labor upon which depends the earning of our miserable bread we cannot even get it a
    laborer lacks the labor upon which his maintenance depends  he asks in vain for a
    tribulation He suffers a second that of obtaining work at times whose fruit is his
    masters and not his or of being employed in duties to which he is entirely
    unaccustomed   The civilized laborer suffers a third affliction through the maladies
    with which he is generally stricken by the excess of labor demanded by his master 
He suffers a fifth affliction that of being despised and treated as a beggar because
    he lacks those necessaries which he consents to purchase by the anguish of repugnant
    labor He suffers finally a sixth affliction in that he will obtain neither advancement
    nor sufficient wages and that to the vexation of present suffering is added the
    perspective of future suffering and of being sent to the gallows should he demand that
    labor which he may lack to morrow
Labor nevertheless forms the delight of various creatures such as beavers bees
    wasps ants which are entirely at liberty to prefer inertia but God has provided them
    with a social mechanism which attracts to industry and causes happiness to be found in
    industry Why should he not have accorded us the same favor as these animals What a
    difference between their industrial condition and ours A Russian an Algerian work from
    fear of the lash or the bastinado an Englishman a Frenchman from fear of the famine
    which stalks close to his poor household the Greeks and the Romans whose freedom has
    been vaunted to us worked as slaves and from fear of punishment like the Negroes in the
    colonies to day
Associative labor in order to exert a strong attraction upon people will have to
    differ in every particular from the repulsive conditions which render it so odious in the
    existing state of things It is necessary in order that it become attractive that
    associative labor fulfill the following seven conditions 

1 That every laborer be a partner remunerated by dividends and not by wages 
    2 That every one man woman or child be remunerated in proportion to the three
    faculties capital labor and talent 
    3 That the industrial sessions be varied about eight times a day it being impossible to
    sustain enthusiasm longer than an hour and a half or two hours in the exercise of
    agricultural or manufacturing labor 
    4 That they be carried on by bands of friends united spontaneously interested and
    stimulated by very active rivalries 
    5 That the workshops and husbandry offer the laborer the allurements of elegance and
    cleanliness 
    6 That the division of labor be carried to the last degree so that each sex and age may
    devote itself to duties that are suited to it 
    7 That in this distribution each one man woman or child be in full enjoyment of the
    right to labor or the right to engage in such branch of labor as they may please to
    select provided they give proof of integrity and ability 
Finally that in this new order people possess a guarantee of well being of a
    minimum sufficient for the present and the future and that this guarantee free them from
    all uneasiness concerning themselves and their families 
We find all these properties combined in the associative mechanism whose discovery I
    make public
In order to attain happiness it is necessary to introduce it into the labors which
    engage the greater part of our lives Life is a long torment to one who pursues
    occupations without attraction Morality teaches us to love work let it know then how
    to render work lovable and first of all let it introduce luxury into husbandry and the
    workshop If the arrangements are poor repulsive how arouse industrial attraction 
In work as in pleasure variety is evidently the desire of nature Any enjoyment
    prolonged without interruption beyond two hours conduces to satiety to abuse blunts
    our faculties and exhausts pleasure A repast of four hours will not pass off without
    excess an opera of four hours will end by cloying the spectator Periodical variety is a
    necessity of the body and of the soul a necessity in all nature even the soil requires
    alteration of seeds and seed alteration of soil The stomach will soon reject the best
    dish if it be offered every day and the soul will be blunted in the exercise of any
    virtue if it be not relieved by some other virtue 
If there is need of variety in pleasure after indulging in it for two hours so much
    the more does labor require this diversity which is continual in the associative state
    and is guaranteed to the poor as well as the rich 
The chief source of light heartedness among Harmonians is the frequent change of
    sessions Life is a perpetual torment to our workmen who are obliged to spend twelve and
    frequently fifteen consecutive hours in some tedious labor Even ministers are not
    exempt we find some of them complain of having passed an entire day in the stupefying
    task of affixing signatures to thousands of official vouchers Such wearisome duties are
    unknown in the associative order the Harmonians who devote an hour an hour and a half
    or at most two hours to the different sessions and who in these short sessions are
    sustained by cabalistic impulses and by friendly union with selected associates cannot
    fail to bring and to find cheerfulness everywhere 
The radical evil of our industrial system is the employment of the laborer in a single
    occupation which runs the risk of coming to a stand still The fifty thousand workmen of
    Lyons who are beggars to day  besides fifty thousand women and children would be
    scattered over two or three hundred phalanxes which would make silk their principal
    article of manufacture and which would not be thrown out by a year or two of stagnation
    in that branch of industry If at the end of that time their factory should fail
    completely they would start one of a different kind without having stopped work without
    ever making their daily subsistence dependent upon a continuation or suspension of outside
    orders
In a progressive series all the groups acquire so much the more skill in that their
    work is greatly subdivided and that every member engages only in the kind in which he
    professes to excel The heads of the Series spurred on to study by rivalry bring to
    their work the knowledge of a student of the first rank The subordinates are inspired
    with an ardor which laughs at all obstacles and with a fanaticism for the maintenance of
    the honor of the Series against rival districts In the heat of action they accomplish
    what seems humanly impossible like the French grenadiers who scaled the rocks of Mahon
    and who upon the day following were unable in cold blood to clamber up the rock which
    they had assailed under the fire of the enemy Such are the progressive Series in their
    work every obstacle vanishes before the intense pride which dominates them they would
    grow angry at the word impossible and the most daunting kinds of labor such as
    managing the soil are to them the lightest of sports If we could to day behold an
    organized district behold at early dawn thirty industrial groups issue in state from the
    palace of the Phalanx and spread themselves over the fields and the workshops waving
    their banners with cries of triumph and impatience we should think we were gazing at
    bands of madmen intent upon putting the neighboring districts to fire and sword Such will
    he the athletes who will take the place of our mercenary and languid workmen and who will
    succeed in making ambrosia and nectar grow upon a soil which yields only briers and tares
    to the feeble hands of the civilized

The announcement does I acknowledge sound very improbable of a method for combining
    three hundred families unequal in fortune and rewarding each person  man woman
    child  according to the three properties capital labor talent More than one reader
    will credit himself with humor when he remarks Let the author try to associate but
    three families to reconcile three households in the same dwelling to social union to
    arrangements of purchases and expenses to perfect harmony in passions character and
    authority when he shall have succeeded in reconciling three mistresses of associated
    households we shall believe that he can succeed with thirty and with three hundred
    
I have already replied to an argument which it is well to reproduce  for repetition
    will frequently be necessary here I have observed that as economy can spring only
    from large combinations God had to create a social theory applicable to large masses and
    not to three or four families 
An objection seemingly more reasonable and which needs to be refuted more than once
    is that of social discords How conciliate the passions the conflicting interests the
    incompatible characters in short the innumerable disparities which engender so much
    discord 
It may easily have been surmised that I shall make use of a lever entirely unknown and
    whose properties cannot be judged until I shall have explained them The passional
    contrasted Series draws its nourishment solely from those disparities which bewilder
    civilized policy it acts like the husbandman who from a mass of filth draws the germs of
    abundance the refuse the dirt and impure matter which would serve only to defile and
    infect our dwellings are for him the sources of wealth
If social experiments have miscarried it is because some fatality has impelled all
    speculators to work with bodies of poor people whom they subjected to a monastic industrial
    discipline chief obstacle to the working of the series Here as in everything else it
    is ever SIMPLISM  simplisme which misleads the civilized obstinately sticking
    to experiments with combinations of the poor they cannot elevate themselves to the
    conception of a trial with combinations of the rich They are veritable Lemming rats
     migrating rats of Lapland preferring drowning in a pond to deviating from the route
    which they have decided upon
It is necessary for a company of 1500 to 1600 persons to have a stretch of land
    comprising a good square league say a surface of six million square toises  do not let us
    forget that a third of that would suffice for the simple mode 
The land should be provided with a fine stream of water it should be intersected by
    hills and adapted to varied cultivation it should be contiguous to a forest and not far
    removed from a large city but sufficiently so to escape intruders 
The experimental Phalanx standing alone and without the support of neighboring
    phalanxes will in consequence of this isolation have so many gaps in attraction and so
    many passional calms to dread in its workings that it will be necessary to provide it
    with the aid of a good location fitted for a variety of functions A flat country such as
    Antwerp Leipzig Orleans would be totally unsuitable and would cause many Series to
    fail owing to the uniformity of the land surface It will therefore be necessary to
    select a diversified region like the surroundings of Lausanne or at the very least a
    fine valley provided with a stream of water and a forest like the valley of Brussels or
    of Halle A fine location near Paris would be the stretch of country lying between Poissy
    and Confleurs Poissy and Meulan 
A company will be collected consisting of from 1500 to 1600 persons of graduated
    degrees of fortune age character of theoretical and practical knowledge care will be
    taken to secure the greatest amount of variety possible for the greater the number of
    variations either in the passions or the faculties of the members the easier will it be
    to make them harmonize in a short space of time 
In this district devoted to experiment there ought to be combined every species of
    practicable cultivation including that in conservatories and hot houses in addition
    there ought to be at least three accessory factories to be used in winter and on rainy
    days furthermore various practical branches of science and the arts independent of the
    schools 
Above all it will be necessary to fix the valuation of the capital invested in shares
    lands materials flocks implements etc This point ought it seems to be among the
    first to receive attention I think it best to dismiss it here I shall limit myself to
    remarking that all these investments in transferable shares and stock coupons will be
    represented 
A great difficulty to be overcome in the experimental Phalanx will be the formation of
    the ties of high mechanism or collective bonds of the Series before the close of the
    first season It will be necessary to accomplish the passional union of the mass of the
    members to lead them to collective and individual devotion to the maintenance of the
    Phalanx and especially to perfect harmony regarding the division of the profits
    according to the three factors Capital Labor Talent 
This difficulty will be greater in northern than in southern countries owing to the
    difference between devoting eight months and five months to agricultural labor 
An experimental Phalanx being obliged to start out with agricultural labor will not
    be in full operation until the month of May  in a climate of 50 degrees say in the region
    around London or Paris and since it will be necessary to form the bonds of general
    union the harmonious ties of the Series be fore the suspension of field labor before
    the month of October there will be barely five months of full practice in a region of 50
    degrees the work will have to be accomplished in that short space 
The trial would therefore be much more conveniently made in a temperate legion like
    Florence Naples Valencia Lisbon where they would have eight to nine months of full
    cultivation and a far better opportunity to consolidate the bonds of union since there
    would be but two or three months of passional calm remaining to tide over till the advent
    of the second spring a time when the Phalanx resuming agricultural labor would form its
    ties and cabals anew with much greater zeal imbuing them with a degree of intensity far
    above that of the first year it would thenceforth be in a state of complete
    consolidation and strong enough to weather the passional calm of the second winter 
We shall see in the chapter on hiatuses of attraction that the first Phalanx will in
    consequence of its social isolation and other impediments inherent to the experimental
    canton have twelve special obstacles to overcome obstacles which the Phalanxes
    subsequently founded would not have to contend with That is why it is so important that
    the experimental canton should have the assistance coming from field work prolonged eight
    or nine months like that in Naples and Lisbon
Let us proceed with the details of composition 
At least seven eighths of the members ought to be cultivators and manufacturers the
    remainder will consist of capitalists scholars and artists 
The Phalanx would be badly graded and difficult to balance if among its capitalists
    there were several having 100000 francs several 50000 francs without intermediate
    fortunes In such a case it would be necessary to seek to procure intermediate fortunes of
    60000 70000 80000 90000 francs The Phalanx best graduated in every respect raises
    social harmony and profits to the highest degree
One is tempted to believe that our sybarites would not wish to be associated with
    Grosjean and Margot they are so even now  as I believe I have already pointed out Is
    not the rich man obliged to discuss his affairs with twenty peasants who occupy his farms
    and who are all agreed in taking illegal advantage of him He is therefore the
    peasants associate obliged to make inquiries about the good and the bad farmers
    their character morals solvency and industry he does associate in a very direct
    and a very tiresome way with Grosjean and Margot In Harmony he will be their
    indirect associate being relieved of accounts regarding the management which will be
    regulated by the regents proctors and special officers without its being necessary for
    the capitalist to intervene or to run any risk of fraud He will therefore be freed from
    the disagreeable features of his present association with the peasantry he will form a
    new one where he will not furnish them anything and where they will only be his obliging
    and devoted friends in accordance with the details given regarding the management of the
    Series and of reunions If he takes the lead at festivals it is because he has agreed to
    accept the rank of captain If he gives them a feast it is because he takes pleasure in
    acknowledging their continual kind attentions 
Thus the argument urged about the repugnance to association between Mondor and
    Grosjean already associated in fact is only like all the others a quibble
    devoid of sense
The edifice occupied by a Phalanx does not in any way resemble our constructions
    whether of the city or country and none of our buildings could be used to establish a
    large Harmony of 1600 persons  not even a seat palace like Versailles nor a great
    monastery like the Escurial If for the purposes of experiment only an inconsiderable
    Harmony of 200 or 300 members or a hongree of 400 members is organized a
    monastery or a palace  Meudon could be used for it 
The lodgings plantations and stables of a Society conducted on the plan of Series of
    groups must differ vastly from our villages and country towns which are intended for
    families having no social connection and which act in a perverse manner in place of that
    class of little houses which rival each other in filth and ungainliness in our little
    towns a Phalanx constructs an edifice for itself which is as regular as the ground
    permits here is a sketch of distribution for a location favorable to development 
The central part of the Palace or Phalanstery ought to be appropriated to peaceful
    uses and contain the dining halls halls for finance libraries study etc In this
    central portion are located the place of worship the tour dordre the
    telegraph the post office boxes the chimes for ceremonials the observatory the winter
    court adorned with resinous plants and situated in the rear of the parade court 
One of the wings ought to combine all the noisy workshops such as the carpenter shop
    the forge all hammer work it ought to contain also all the industrial gatherings of
    children who are generally very noisy in industry and even in music. This combination
    will obviate a great annoyance of our civilized cities where we find some man working
    with a hammer in every street some dealer in iron or tyro on the clarionet who shatter
    the tympanum of fifty families in the vicinity. 
The other wing ought to contain the caravansary with its ballrooms and its halls
    appropriated to intercourse with outsiders so that these may not encumber the central
    portion of the palace and embarrass the domestic relations of the Phalanx
