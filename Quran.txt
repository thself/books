FOREWORD 

By Shaikh Salih ibn l Abd al- 'Aziz ibn Muhammad Al- al Shaikh, 

Minister for Islamic Affairs, 

Endowments, Da' wah and Guidance. 

The Supervisor General of the Complex 

P nil sc be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, Who says in His Glorious 
Book, "There has come to you from Allah a Light and a plain Book”* and 
peace and blessings of Allah be upon the noblest of the Prophets and 
Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad who has said, "The best of you is he 
who learns the Qur'an and teaches it”. 

Following the directives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King 
"Abdullah ibn "Abd al-'Aziz Al Sa L ud* may Allah guard him* to give the book 
of Allah all the importance due to it, its publication* its distribution 
throughout the world, preparation of its commentary and translation of its 
meanings into different languages of the world; and in view of the firm faith 
of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, Da "wah and Guidance in tire 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the importance of translating the meanings of the 
Glorious Qur'an into all the important languages of the world to enable the 
non- Arabic -speaking Muslims to understand it, and in fulfilment of the 
injunction of the Prophet ^ " Convey my message even if it be one single 
ayah", And with the view to serve our English- speaking brethren, King Fahd 
Complex For the Printing of the Holy Qur'an at al-Madrnah al-Munawwarah 
has the pleasure to present the English-speaking reader with this English 
translation by Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud Din al-Hilali and Dr. Muhammad 
Muhsin Khan* which has been revised on behalf of the Complex by Fazal 
Hahi Zaliir, Dr. Amin ad -Dm Abu Bakr, Dr. Wajih Abderrahman and Dr. 
V.'Abdur Rahim. 

We praise Allah subhdnahu vva ta'ala for His favour to us in completing 
this great work, praying Him to accept this as a sincere service for His sake, 
and for the benefit of mankind. 

We are aware of the fact that the translation of the meanings of the 
Glorious Qur'an, however accurate it may be, must fall short of conveying the 
wealth of meaning that the miraculous text of the original conveys; and that 
the meaning conveyed by translation is only the sum total of what the 
translator has understood from the text of the Glorious Book of Allah, and 
that it cannot escape the defects and drawbacks that are inherent in every 
human endeavour. We, therefore, request every reader of this translation to 
furnish tire Complex with any mistakes, omission or addition that he may find 
in it so that they may be eliminated in subsequent editions in aha Allah. 

It is Allah Who bestows success* and guides to the Straight Path. G Allah! 
Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the All -Hearer, the All- 
Knowcr,

The Noble Qur'an - A Miracle from Allah 
(to Prophet Muhammad A j U* £\ 











"And this Qur’an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah 
(Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) 
which was before it [i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Inject (Gospel)] and a full 
explanation of the Book(i.c. the laws decreed for mankind) — wherein there is 
no doubt — from the Lord of the ' Atamm (mankind jinn, and all that exists)." 
(V. 10:37)

Narrated Abu Iluraira ^ ur^j : The Prophet Aj said, 

"There- was no Prophet among the Prophets but was given miracles because of 
which people had belief, but what I have been given is the Divine Revelation 
which Allah has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more 
than those of any other Prophet on the Day of Resurrection." (Iladith No. 379,

Narrated JSbir bin 'Abdullah ^ — >j ; Some angels eatne to the 

Pro ph e L (Muhammad ,4 — -j ^ J^) while he was sleeping. Some of them 

said, "He is sleeping/' Others said, “His eyes arc sleeping but his heart is 
awake/* Then they said, "There is an example for this companion of yours.” 
One of them said, "Then set forth an example for him/* One of them said, 
"He is sleeping,” Another said, "His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake,” 
Then they said, "Ills example is that of a man who built a house and then 
offered therein a banquet and sent an invitcr (messenger) to invite the people. 
lSo whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ale of 
the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the in viter, did not 
enter the house, nor did he car of the banquet." Then the angels said, 
"Interpret this parable to him so that he may understand it/’ One of them said, 
"He is sleeping," The others said, "His eyes are sleeping but his heart is 
awake.” And then they said, "The house stands for Paradise and the c allmaker 

v 

is Muhammad fJL-j aJL* *ut and whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; 
and whoever disobeys Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad separated the 
people (i.e., through his message, the good is distinguished from the bad, and 
the believers from the disbelievers).”

|L| (V.l:2) Lord; The actual word used in the Qur'an is Rabb . There is no proper 
equivalent for Rabb in English language, 1 1 means the One and the Only Lord for all 
the universe, its Creator, Owner, Organizer, Provider, Master, Planner, Sustainer, 
Cherisher, and Giver of security. Rabb is also one of the Names of Allah. We have 
used the word “Lord” as the nearest to Rabb. All occurrences of “Lord” in the 
interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an actually mean Rabb and should be 
understood as such, 

l2J (V.l:2) Narrated Abu SaTd bin Al-Mu'alla: While 1 was praying in the mosque, 
Allah’s Messenger j ^ called me but 1 did not respond to him. Later I 
said, “G Allah’s Messenger, J w r as praying.” He said, “Didn't Allah say — Answer 
Allah (by obeying Him) and 11 is Messenger when he A) calls you." (V. 

8:24). He then said to me, “I wall leaeh you a Surah which is the greatest Surah in the 
Qur’an, before you leave the mosque.” Then he got hold of my hand, and when he 
intended to leave (the mosque), 1 said to him, “Didn't you say to me, 14 I will teach you 
a Surah which is the greatest Surah in the Qur'an?” He said, “Al-Hamdu Ullahi 
Rabbi!- alarnin [i.e. all praise and thanks are Allah’s, the Lord of the 'Alamin 
(mankind, jinn and all that exists)], Surat Al-Fdlihah which is As-Sab* Al-Mathdm 
(i.e. the seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur’an w r hich has been given 
to me.” (Sahih At- Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No. I). 

^ (V.l :6) Guidance is of two kinds: 

a) Guidance of Taufiq which Is totally from Allah, i.e, Allah opens one's heart to 
receive the truth (from disbelief to Belief in Islamic Monotheism). 

b) Guidance of Irshdd i.e, through preaching by Alldh's Messengers and the pious 
preachers who preach the truth i.e. Islamic Monotheism. 

(V, 1 :7) i.e. the way of the Prophets, the Siddiqim (i.e, those followers of the 



Surah 1. Al-Fatihah 




Part 1 



those whose intentions are perverted: they know the Truth, yet 
do not follow it), nor of those w ho w ent astray (i.e. those w ho 
have lost the (true) knowledge, so they wander in error, and 
are not guided to the Truth)* * 111, 



Prophet, who were first and foremost to believe in him, like Abu Bakr As-Siddiq), the 
martyrs and the righteous, fas Allah Jk- j .> said: "And whoso obeys Allah and the 
Messenger (Muhammad Aj Zi AA then they will be in the company of those 
on whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddtqun, the martyrs, 
and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!” (V.4:69)]. 

(V.l:7) Narration about Zaid bin "Amr bin Nufail. 

Narrated "Abdullah bin "Umar 4i1 : The Prophet Aj A A- 3 met Zaid 

bin ‘Ami bin Nufail in the bottom of (the valley of) Baldah before (he descent of any 
Divine revelation to the Prophet A? A A 1 - 3 . A meal was presented to the 
Prophet Aj ^ A^ but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid) 
who said, “I do not eat anything which you slaughter on your Nusub* in the name of 
your idols etc. 1 cat only those (animals meat) on winch Allah's Name has been 
mentioned at the time of (their) slaughtering.” Zaid bin ‘Amr used to criticise the way 
Quraish used to slaughter their animals and used to sayf" Allah has created the sheep 
and lie has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from 
the earth; yet you slaughter it in others than the Name of Allah.” He used to say so, 
for he rejected that practice and considered it as something abominable. 

* Nusub ; Sec the glossary. 

Narrated I bn "Umar A ^ iAj : Zaid bin "Amr bin Nufail went to Sham (the region 
comprising Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan), enquiring about a true religion to 
follow. 



He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He said, “l 
intend to embrace your religion, so tell me something about it.” The Jew said, ""You 
will not embrace our religion unless you receive your share of Allah's Anger,” Zaid 
said, ""I do not run except from Allah's Anger, and 1 will never bear a bit of it if 1 have 
the power to avoid it. Can you tell me of some other religion?” He said, ”1 do not 
know any other religion except //^/(Islamic Monotheism): Zaid enquired, “What is 
Hantj ?” lie said, i% Hanif is the religion of (the Prophet) Abraham A*Il he was 
neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used to worship none but Allah (Alone) — 
Islamic Monotheism.” Then Zaid went out and met a Christian religious scholar and 
told him the same (as before). The Christian said, '"You will not embrace our religion 
unless you get a share of Allah’s Curse,” Zaid replied, “I do not run except from 
Allah’s Curse, and I will never bear any of Allah's Curse and His Anger if 1 have the 
power to avoid them. Will you tell me of some other religion?” He replied, “I do not 
know any other religion except Hanif (Islamic Monotheism)." Zaid enquired, “What 
is Hanif?" He replied “Hanif is the religion of (the Prophet) Abraham AJi A, he 
was neither a Jew nor a Christian, (and he used to worship none but Allah (Alone) — 
Islamic Monotheism,” When Zaid heard their statement about (the religion ol) 
Abraham, he left that place, and when he came out, he raised both his hands and said, 
"‘O Allah! 1 make You my Witness that I am on the religion of Abraham”, 

Narrated Asma* bint Abt Bakr A ^ Aj : I saw Zaid bin "Amr bin Nufail standing 
with his back against the Ka hah and saying, " L D people of Quraish! By Allah, none 
amongst you is on the religion of Abraham except me.” She added: He (Zaid) used to

presen e the lives of little girls; if somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say 
to him, “Do not kill her for 1 will feed her on your behalf.” So he would take her, and 
when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, ‘Now if you will (wish), l will 
give her to you, and if you will (wish), I wall feed her on your behalf,” (Sahih Al- 
Bukhdn, Vol.5, Hadith NoJ69). 

(V r 1:7) Narrated ‘Ubadah bin As-Simit ^ j ; Alldh’s Messenger ^ 

said, “Whoever does not recite Surat A 1-Fat i hah in his prayer, his prayer is 
invalid” {Sahih A l- Bukhari, Voll s Hadith No,723), 

(V, 1:7) Narrated Abu Hurairah ^ : Allah's Messenger ;jr U^

of those who earned Your Anger, nor the way of those who went astray (1:7)]* then 
you must say, Amin, for if one's utterance of A mm coincides with that of the angels, 
then his past sins will be forgiven.” {Sahih A l-B ukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No. 2),
